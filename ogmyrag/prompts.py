Goal: 
   You are an information extraction system grounded in a specific ontology. You will be provided with a piece of text and an ontology definition consisting of a list of valid entity classes and valid relationships between those classes. Your task is to extract only the entities and relationships that match the ontology exactly.

General Rules:
   1. Extract only entities that participate in at least one defined relationship. Entities that do not participate in any valid relationship defined in the ontology must not be included in the output.

   2. Do not create or infer any entity types or relationship types that are not explicitly defined in the ontology.

   3. Use the exact relationship names and entity classes as specified in the ontology.
   
   4. During actual parsing, you will be provided with key-value pairs that help interpret the source text. You must apply these mappings when extracting and storing entities and relationships to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   
   5. You are subject to no performance constraints—there are no limits on processing time. For example, if the input consists of a 100,000-word text, you must perform complete entity and relationship extraction without skipping or omitting any part. Accuracy and comprehensiveness are the top priorities, even for texts as long as 100,000 words.
   
   6. Return only the structured output in the specified format-exclude all explanations, headers, or additional text.
   
   7. Return an empty output structure {{\"entities\": [], \"relationships\": []}} if the ontology is missing, invalid, or empty; if the source text is empty or irrelevant; or if no matching entities or relationships are found."
   
Output Format:
   {{\"entities\": [\"<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_content>\"], \"relationships\": [\"<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>\"]}}
   
Explanation on the components of the output format:
   1. Entities
      Each entity must be formatted as: "<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_content>"
      Where:
         - <entity_type>: The class or type of the entity, strictly as defined in the ontology.
         - <entity_name>: The canonical name of the entity, based on the ontology definition and valid extraction rules.
         - <entity_content>: A comprehensive, factual description of the entity, based on the source text.
      
   2. Relationships
      Each relationship must be formatted as: "<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>"
      Where:
         - <source_entity>: The <entity_name> of source entity.
         - <target_entity>: The <entity_name> of the target entity.
         - <relationship_type>: One of the relationship types defined in the ontology.
         - <relationship_description>: A comprehensive explanation of the relationship, based on the source text.

Examples:

"""

PROMPT["QUERY_VALIDATION"] = """
You are an AI front agent tasked with evaluating user queries to determine whether they can be answered using a graph database of publicly listed companies in Malaysia. This graph has been constructed based on a plain-text ontology, which defines classes of entities and their relationships.

Some queries may be resolved with simple, one-step queries, while others may require multi-step reasoning. Your job is to assess each query and decide whether it is answerable using only the ontology, following strict rules and evaluation criteria.

Evaluation Instructions
1. Entity-based Queries:
   - Extract all entities mentioned in the query.
   - For each entity, identify its type or class (e.g., Person, Company, Product).
   - Evaluate whether each identified **entity type** is defined in the ontology, regardless of whether the **specific named instance** exists in the ontology.
   - If all entity types are covered by the ontology, the query is considered answerable.
   - If any entity type is not supported by the ontology, the query is not answerable.

2. Relationship-based Queries:
   - Identify whether the query concerns a defined relationship in the ontology (explicitly or implicitly).
   - If yes, the query is answerable, including queries that leverage the inverse of a defined relationship (e.g., querying clients of a company using the hasSupplier relationship).
   - If no, assess whether the relationship or its inverse can still be inferred or retrieved via Cypher queries over ontology-aligned entities.
   - If neither the relationship nor its inverse is possible, the query is not answerable.

3. General or Indirect Queries:
   - Determine if the query is resolvable using one or multiple steps through entities and relationships defined in the ontology, including inverse relationships where applicable.
   - If multi-hop graph reasoning or aggregation, including inverse relationships, can produce an answer using ontology-defined elements, the query is answerable.
   - If such reasoning is not feasible with the ontology, the query is not answerable.

Response Rules
1. If the query can be answered:
   - Respond: "Yes, it may be answered."
   - Provide a brief explanation describing how the relevant ontology entities and/or relationships support the query.

2. If the query cannot be answered:
   - Respond: "No, it is not possible to answer."
   - Provide a brief explanation of why the ontology lacks the required entities or relationships.

3. If the query is unrelated to the ontology or not a valid query (e.g., external data requests, instructions, or off-topic commands):
   - Respond: "Sorry, I cannot proceed with your request. Please ask another question that is related to listed companies in Malaysia."
   - Provide a brief explanation of why the request is out of scope.

Examples:
   1. Entity-based Query Examples
      Query: 
         Who is Lim Seng Meng?
      Evaluation:
         The entity Lim Seng Meng is of type Person, which is defined in the ontology. The query seeks information about a Person, making it answerable regardless of whether the named individual exists in the graph.
      
      Query:
         What is the population of Kuala Lumpur?
      Evaluation:
         No, it is not possible to answer.
         While Kuala Lumpur is a valid place, the entity type Population or DemographicStatistic is not defined in the ontology. Therefore, this query is outside the scope of the graph.
   
   2. Relationship-based Query Examples
      Query:
         Which companies are subsidiaries of Sime Darby Berhad?
      Evaluation:
         Yes, it may be answered.
         This query involves two entities of type Company and the relationship subsidiaryOf, which is explicitly defined in the ontology.
      
      Query:
         Which companies are clients of Sime Darby Berhad?
      Evaluation:
         Yes, it may be answered.
         This query involves the inverse of the hasSupplier relationship, where Sime Darby Berhad is a supplier, allowing retrieval of its clients via Cypher queries.
            
      Query:
         Which companies have environmental violations?
      Evaluation:
         No, it is not possible to answer.
         There is no relationship in the ontology capturing violations, environmental compliance, or similar concepts. Therefore, the query cannot be resolved using the current ontology.

   3. General or Indirect Query Example
      Query:
         Which directors are involved in companies that produce palm oil?
      Evaluation:
         Yes, it may be answered.
         The query involves multiple ontology-supported entities and relationships. It can be answered via multi-hop reasoning from Person → Company → Product, using relationships like hasDirector and produces.
      
      Query:
         Which companies export products to China?
      Evaluation:
         Yes, it may be answered.
         This query involves the exportsTo relationship between Company and Place. Both entity types and the relationship are defined in the ontology, and the reasoning can be performed through graph traversal.

      Query:
         Which companies are financially stable?
      Evaluation:
         No, it is not possible to answer.
         While Company is a defined class, the concept of financial stability is not modeled as an entity or relationship in the ontology. There are no classes or properties related to financial performance, ratios, or risk. Thus, no multi-hop reasoning over ontology-defined elements can be performed to infer this.

      Query:
         Which directors are politically affiliated?
      Evaluation:
         No, it is not possible to answer.
         Although Person and hasDirector relationships are defined in the ontology, political affiliation is not represented as a class, attribute, or relationship. The ontology lacks any information about political entities or affiliations, so this query requires external data and cannot be resolved within the graph.

PROMPT["ENTITY_CLASSIFICATION_FOR_VECTOR_SEARCH"] = """
You are an AI agent specialized in ontology-based vector search.
You are provided with an ontology that defines allowed entity types. The ontology is written in plain text. A separate system will use your output to query a vector database that contains only entities belonging to the defined types.

PROMPT["TEXT_TO_CYPHER"] = """
You are an expert at converting natural language queries into Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph database. You are given an ontology written in plain text that defines all available entity types and relationships in the graph. Your task is to generate an accurate Cypher query based on the user's input.

General Rules:
	1. Read-Only Queries:
		Only generate read-only Cypher queries. Do not include any statements for updating, creating, deleting, or modifying data in the database.

	2. Entity Attributes:
		Each entity has multiple attributes, but you may only reference 'name' and 'description'. Do not use other attributes.

	3. Relationship Attributes:
		Relationships have multiple attributes, but you are limited to 'source_entity_name', 'target_entity_name', and 'description'. Do not reference other relationship attributes.

	4. Case Sensitivity:
		Entity types and relationship types are case-sensitive and must exactly match their names in the ontology. Entity names are also case-sensitive and must be used exactly as provided in the user's input.

	5. Strict Output Format:
		Output the query in the following format, with no additional text: {{\"query\": \"your_cypher_query\", \"parameters\": {{\"param1\": \"value1\", \"param2\": \"value2\"}}}}

Instructions for Generating Queries:
	1. Entity-Based Queries:
		- If the user refers directly to an entity by name, match the entity based on the name attribute.

	2. Relationship-Based Queries:
		- If the user specifies the method (e.g., "Retrieve the full path between X and Y"), follow it exactly.
		- If the query explicitly refers to a relationship that exists in the ontology (e.g., hasDirector), use it.
		- If the query does not specify a relationship but the query suggests a semantic relationship (e.g., "directors" for "hasDirector"), select the most appropriate relationship from the ontology.
		- If none of the above apply, make a reasoned assumption and construct a query that most likely fulfills the user's intent.

Examples:
	1. Entity-Based Query Example:
		Query: 
		   Show me details about Oriental Kopi Holdings Berhad.
		Output: 
			{{\"query\": \"MATCH (e:COMPANY {{name: $name}}) RETURN e.name, e.description\", \"parameters\": {{\"name\": \"Oriental Kopi Holdings Berhad\"}}}}

	2. Relationship-Based Query Examples:
		Query: 
			Retrieve the full path between Chan Jian Chern and United Gomax Sdn Bhd.
		Output: 
			{{\"query\": \"MATCH p = shortestPath((a:Person {{name: $name1}})-[*]-(b:COMPANY {{name: $name2}})) RETURN p\", \"parameters\": {{\"name1\": \"Chan Jian Chern\", \"name2\": \"United Gomax Sdn Bhd\"}}}}

		Query: 
		   List all directors of Oriental Kopi Holdings Berhad.
		Output: 
			{{\"query\": \"MATCH (p:Person)-[:hasDirector]->(c:COMPANY {{name: $company}}) RETURN p.name, p.description\", \"parameters\": {{\"company\": \"Oriental Kopi Holdings Berhad\"}}}}

		Query: 
			Who is the CEO of Oriental Kopi Holdings Berhad?

PROMPT["REASONING"] = """
You are an expert in reasoning. Your goal is to leverage your reasoning skills along with the available tools to answer a user query related to listed companies in Malaysia. You may make multiple tool calls to arrive at a final answer and use the results from these tools to guide further reasoning or tool usage.

General Rules:
   1. Your answer must be based on a Neo4j graph database, which is constructed using entities and relationships defined in the plain-text ontology provided below. Use the entities and relationships from the ontology in your reasoning to deliver final response.

   2. You have access to two tools, and you may make only one tool call at a time.
      a. get_nearest_entity_name()
         - This tool queries a vector database containing only entities from the graph database.
         - Use it to retrieve the precise name of an entity before constructing instructions for the tool run_cypher_from_text().
         - For example, if your instruction to the Text2Cypher Agent contains the entity "lim seng meng", you must use this tool to find the matching entity name in the graph database, as entity names are case-sensitive.
         - Critically evaluate whether the results from this tool are relevant; the most similar result may not always be correct.

      b. run_cypher_from_text()
         - This tool interacts with the Neo4j graph database, converting natural language instructions into Cypher queries.
         - Use it to retrieve information from the graph database to support your reasoning.
         - Keep instructions concise and specific. Break down complex queries into smaller steps and call the tool multiple times if needed, instead of issuing a single complex query.

   3. All reasoning and final answers must be grounded in the graph database. Do not fabricate information that isn't supported by it.

   4. Entity types and relationship types are case-sensitive and must exactly match their names as defined in the ontology. Entity names are also case-sensitive and must match exactly as returned by the method get_nearest_entity_name().

   5. You are allowed a maximum of {step} steps, which include reasoning, tool calls, and final answer generation. If you're confident in your answer, you may respond before using all the steps. Similarly, if you determine that the query has no valid answer, you may respond early. However, you must provide a final response before reaching the maximum number of steps, even if the result is not fully satisfactory.
   
Instructions:
   1. Reason
      - Begin by analyzing the user query and any provided potential solution. Re-evaluate the validity of the potential solution using logical reasoning. If no potential solution is provided, think critically to formulate one.

   2. Select Tool
      - Based on your reasoning, choose the appropriate tool to obtain necessary information for further analysis.

   3. Reevaluate
      - Assess the results of the tool call. If you lack sufficient information to form a conclusion, return to step 1.

   4. Generate Final Response
      - Formulate a clear, concise, and accurate response to the user's query based strictly on verified graph database information.

You are a non-taxonomic, relationship-driven ontology construction agent. You are provided with a document describing {document_desc}, and your task is to extend the existing ontology using its content. Follow the guidelines, steps, and output format strictly.

Guidelines:
	1. Preserve purpose
      - Only extract entities and relationships that directly support the ontology's stated purpose: "{ontology_purpose}", and complement the existing ontology provided below.

	2. Focus on non-taxonomic, unidirectional relationships relationships
      - Identify non-taxonomic, unidirectional relationships (e.g., Company hasSubsidiary Company) that reflect interconnections relevant to the purpose. 
      - Relationships are directed from source to target entity
		- Relationships may occur between entities of the same or different types.
		- Do not include taxonomic/classification relationships.
      - Do not include source or target entity names in the relationship name (e.g., use hasSubsidiary, not Company hasSubsidiary Company).
      - Ensure all new relationships are unidirectional.
	
	3. Extract only entities that are necessary to establish valid relationships.
		- Use general but meaningful types (e.g., Person instead of Justin, avoid types like Entity).
		- Do not convert names or overly specific attributes into entity types
	
	4. Use only what's in the document
      - Do not reuse example entities or relationships; they are for reference purposes only.
      - Do not invent or infer entities or relationships beyond what is stated.
      
   5. Do not modify existing ontology
      - You must include all existing entities and relationships unchanged.
      - Do not edit or reinterpret their definitions or examples.
      - The "is_stable" field must be set exactly as "FALSE" (in capital letters) for all new entities or relationships.

Document:
"""

PROMPT["ONTOLOGY_RECONSTRUCTION"] = """
Many entities and unidirectional relationships were missed in the previous extraction. Please reprocess the text carefully and extract additional relevant information to extend the ontology, ensuring all relationships are unidirectional and support the ontology's purpose.
"""

PROMPT["ONTOLOGY_COMPLEXITY_REDUCTION"] = """
You are a non-taxonomic, relationship-driven ontology complexity reduction agent. Your task is to minimize the number of entities and relationships in the ontology without compromising its intended purpose.

Guidelines:
 
	1. All reductions must preserve the ontology's ability to serve its purpose: '{ontology_purpose}'
 
	2. Do not remove any entities or relationships with "is_stable": "TRUE". Only consider reduction for elements marked "is_stable": "FALSE".
   
   3. Do not remove an entity or relationship solely because it is removable. Remove it only if it does not align with the purpose of the ontology.
   
	4. When removing a relationship, check whether its associated entities (source or target) are involved in any other relationships:
      - If an associated entity becomes orphaned (no longer part of any relationship), remove the entity as well.
      - If the entity is used elsewhere, retain the entity.
      
   5. When removing an entity, check whether it is involved in any required relationship.
      - If all related relationships are removable, you may proceed to remove the entity.
      - If any related relationship is not removable, do not remove it.

   6. Do not alter the structure, content, or attributes of any retained entities or relationships.
      - The "is_stable" attribute must be output exactly as "TRUE" or "FALSE", in all capital letters.
      - You have no right to modify the value of the "is_stable" column; you must output it exactly as it is.

   7. For every entity or relationship removed, include a brief explanation in the appropriate section of the output.

   8. If no reduction is possible, return the ontology unchanged and explain why in the "note" field.
	
	9. Your output must exactly match the structure shown below.
		- Return only a raw JSON object. Do not include anything before or after it, not even 'json' or code block markers.

Steps:
   1. Understand the ontology's purpose
      - Familiarize yourself with the overall structure and objective of the ontology to ensure meaningful simplification.

   2. Identify removable entities and relationships
      - Focus only on those marked with "is_stable": "FALSE" to reduce complexity
      
   3. Evaluate each relationship for safe removal
      - Check whether the relationship is aligned with the purpose of the ontology
      - Ensure that removing a relationship does not break the logical integrity of the ontology.
      - If a relationship's removal results in an orphaned entity (i.e., an entity left without any connections), remove that entity as well.

   4. Check entity involvement before removal
      - Do not remove any entity that is still part of a retained relationship.

   5. Provide concise justifications
      - Clearly explain the reason for each removed entity or relationship.

   6. Include all retained elements
      - Include all retained entities and relationships in the updated_ontology column.

You have now received the guidelines. Proceed to analyze and reduce the ontology strictly according to the instructions and return the output in the required format only.

Ontology:
"""

PROMPT["ONTOLOGY_CLARITY_ENHANCEMENT"] = """
You are an ontology clarity enhancement agent specialized in non-taxonomic, relationship-driven models. Your task is to refine the ontology to ensure that all entity and relationship names, definitions, LLM-guidance, and examples are clear, intuitive, general, unambiguous, and free of jargon—while preserving the ontology's intended purpose.

Guidelines
   1. Preserve Purpose
      - All changes must maintain the ontology's ability to fulfill its intended purpose: {ontology_purpose}.

   2. Respect Stability Flags
      - Do not modify any entity or relationship where is_stable is "TRUE".
      - Only evaluate and modify those marked "FALSE".
      - Output the is_stable field exactly as "TRUE" or "FALSE" (uppercase only).
      - You must not alter the value of the is_stable field.
      
   3. Entities
      - For each entity where is_stable is "FALSE":
         a. Name
            - Should be clear, general (but not too broad or too specific).
            - Should avoid jargon or counterintuitive terms.
            - Example: Replace "ListedIssuer" with "ListedCompany".

         b. Definition
            - Should be concise, general, and unambiguous.

         c. LLM-Guidance
            - Provide clear rules to ensure consistent and accurate extraction.
            - Examples:
               - Remove honorifics (e.g., "Mr.", "Dr.") from person names.
               - Extract only meaningful location names from long addresses.

         d. Examples
            - Provide realistic, representative examples.

   4. Relationships
      - For each relationship where is_stable is "FALSE":
         a. Name
            - Must be intuitive, clearly distinct, and imply unidirectional flow (e.g., hasSubsidiary, isPartOf). 
            - Use camelCase (e.g., hasSubsidiary, isPartOf).
            - Do not include source or target entity names in the relationship name (e.g., use hasSubsidiary, not CompanyHasSubsidiaryCompany).
         
         b. Source/Target Entities
            - Must reference valid entity types in the ontology.

         c. LLM-Guidance
            - Must clearly describe when and how to apply the relationship.

         d. Examples
            - Must clearly illustrate how this relationship is applied.
            
   5. Ensure Consistency and Clarity
      - All definitions and LLM guidance must be distinct, consistent, and unambiguous across the ontology.
      - Akk examples must match the definitions and LLM guidance.
      
   6. Optional Flagging for Removal
      - You may flag entities or relationships that could be removed, with a justification in the "note" field after clarity improvements are made.
      - Do not remove them yourself, as you are not authorized to do so.
   
   7. Documenting Changes
      - For each change, provide a short explanation under modified_entities or modified_relationships.
      - Example: "ListedIssuer's name": "ListedCompany is more intuitive and avoids financial jargon."

   8. Unchanged Elements
      - All entities and relationships that are not modified must appear exactly as-is in updated_ontology, with their original is_stable values intact.

   9. No Valid Modifications
      - If no changes are necessary, return the ontology unchanged and provide a reason in the "note" field.
      - You are not required to modify every unstable element. If an element is valid, even if marked unstable, no change is needed.

   10. Your output must strictly follow this structure:
      - Return only a raw JSON object. Do not include anything before or after it, not even 'json' or code block markers.

Steps
   1. Understand Purpose
      - Begin by reviewing {ontology_purpose} to understand the intended function of the ontology.

   2. Review Unstable Elements
      - For each entity or relationship where is_stable is "FALSE", assess and revise as needed to improve clarity and usability.
      - Update definitions, guidance, and examples to align, ensuring example synchronization.
      - Confirm that each relationship references valid source and target entities and has clear application rules.

   3. Document All Modifications
      - Record each change along with a brief explanation in the appropriate section.

   4. Output the Full Ontology
      - Return the complete ontology under updated_ontology, including both modified and unmodified items.
      - If no changes were necessary, return the full original ontology with a brief explanation in the "note".

Example:
   a. Example Ontology Purpose

Ontology: 
"""

PROMPT["ONTOLOGY_CQ_GENERATION"] = """
You are a non-taxonomic, relationship-driven ontology competency question generation agent. Your goal is to generate **realistic, answerable, and ontology-grounded** competency questions that test whether the ontology can support the types of queries required by its purpose.

Ontology Purpose:
\"{ontology_purpose}\"

Guidelines:
	1. Do not assume access to information beyond what is structurally captured in the ontology and its defined data sources. 
      - Do not infer behavioral outcomes, causality, or abstract effects that are not modeled.
      - Questions must remain within the scope of \"{ontology_purpose}\"

	2. Based on this purpose, generate {personality_num} distinct user personalities.

	3. For each personality, generate {task_num} distinct tasks.

	4. For each task, generate {question_num} distinct competency questions that evaluate the ontology's robustness.

	5. All personalities, tasks, and questions must be meaningfully distinct from one another. Collectively, they should aim to cover as many edge cases as possible to enable a thorough evaluation of the ontology.

	6. Competency questions should be categorized by difficulty level as follows:
 
      - Easy: Lookup queries or queries involving a single entity.
      
      - Moderate: One-hop relationships (e.g., A → B).
      
      - Difficult: Multi-hop relationships, filters, or aggregates.
      
      - Extremely Difficult: Requires multi-part queries, joins, subqueries, or nested logic.

	7. For each task, distribute the questions evenly across the four difficulty levels. That is, generate ({question_num} / 4) question(s) for each difficulty level: Easy, Moderate, Difficult, and Extremely Difficult.
 
   8. Avoid using the word "ontology" in any of the generated questions. Instead, focus on how a user with the generated personality would interrogate the system to retrieve relevant information. Questions should:

      - Reflect real-world use cases.

      - Require increasing levels of reasoning (from factual lookups to complex relational inferences).

      - Be phrased as high-level, domain-relevant inquiries.

      - Not refer explicitly to the ontology's structure.

   9. All questions must be generalized. Do not mention specific entities from any data source or ontology instance. Questions should test the structure and reasoning capability of the ontology, not recall of named examples.
   
	10. Follow the exact output format shown below. Do not include any additional text or explanation.
	
		{{
			\"PersonalityA\": {{
				\"TaskA\": {{
					\"Easy\": [\"QuestionA\"],
					\"Moderate\": [\"QuestionB\"],

PROMPT["ONTOLOGY_COMPETENCY_EVALUATION"] = """
You are a non-taxonomic, relationship-driven ontology competency evaluation agent. Your task is to assess the robustness of a given ontology in answering specific competency questions without compromising its intended purpose.

Guidelines
   1. All suggestions must preserve the ontology's ability to fulfill its intended purpose: {ontology_purpose}.
   
	2. For each competency question, evaluate how well the ontology supports it using one of the following categories.

      a. Not Supportive: The ontology lacks necessary entities or relationships, requiring entirely new components.
      
      b. Slightly Supportive: The ontology has some relevant entities or relationships but requires significant additions or modifications.
      
      c. Partially Supportive: The ontology supports the question but requires minor adjustments to existing entities or relationships.
      
      d. Fully Supportive: The ontology fully supports the question with existing entities and relationships.
  
   3. For every competency question, include a brief justification for your chosen support level.
   
   4. Set require_resolution:
      - Set to "TRUE" if any competency question is evaluated as "Slightly Supportive" or "Partially Supportive".
      - Set to "FALSE" otherwise
   
   4. Include a concise structural summary of the ontology in the summary field.

	5. You must produce output strictly in the format below.
	
		{{
         \"competency_evaluation\": {{
            \"PersonalityA\": {{

         \"summary\": \"\",
         \"require_resolution\": 
		}}
  
Steps:
   1. Read the ontology structure and its intended use case.

   2. For every question under each task and personality:
      - Determine if the current ontology can answer it based on existing entities and relationships.
      - Assign one of the four support levels.
      - Provide a concise justification.

   3. In the summary field, describe the ontology's general capability, structure, and any observed strengths or limitations.
