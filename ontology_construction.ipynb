Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\\n2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\\nThe ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\",\n",
