      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",
      "   \n",

      "\n",
      "You are an ontology enhancement agent tasked with improving the given ontology based on the provided feedback and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "\n",
      "You are an ontology enhancement agent tasked with improving the given ontology based on the provided feedback and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "Evaluation Result:\n",
      "Feedback 1:\n",
      "  Issue: The relationship personHoldsPositionAtCompany encodes the position title directly in the relationship instance label.\n",
      "  Impact: Labels become non-canonical and inconsistent; annotators may diverge on how to represent position titles in relationship instances, violating the no-label-encoding constraint.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Introduce a new entity type Position (with attributes title and optionally other metadata) and replace personHoldsPositionAtCompany with two relationships: holdsPosition (source: Person, target: Position) and positionAtCompany (source: Position, target: Company).\n",

      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",
      "   \n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "Evaluation Result:\n",
      "Feedback 1:\n",
      "  Issue: The Position entity combined with holdsPosition and positionAtCompany relationships constitutes a reified ternary relationship (Person–Position–Company).\n",
      "  Impact: Violates the non-reified entity principle, adds complexity and risks inconsistent instantiation of roles.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Remove the Position entity and both relationships; introduce a single relationship holdsPositionAtCompany (source: Person, target: Company) whose instance label encodes the position title (e.g., “Choo Chin Peng holdsPositionAtCompany Autocount Dotcom Berhad as Chief Financial Officer”).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 2:\n",
      "  Issue: Project and Contract entities overlap: both model formal engagements between a company and counterparties.\n",
      "  Impact: Redundancy may cause confusion, inconsistent usage, and hinder compactness.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Merge Project into Contract (using Contract to represent all engagements) or clearly differentiate their scopes; preferably remove the Project entity and use Contract with an attribute or instance label to denote project-specific details (scope, client, period).\n",

      "Feedback 3:\n",
      "  Issue: The ProjectPhase entity introduces fine-grained complexity for project lifecycle stages.\n",

      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      4. No Reified Entities\n",
      "         - You must not propose or preserve reified entities (entities that represent relationships as nodes).\n",
      "         - Any existing reified entity in the ontology must be refactored into one or more normal relationship types.\n",
      "         - All guidance and examples must reflect this refactoring approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",
      "   \n",
      "         {\n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",
