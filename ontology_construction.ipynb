      "    \"ICT_ZONE_ASIA_BERHAD_IPO_SECTION_9\": \"# 9 RISK FACTORS\\n\\nYOU SHOULD EVALUATE AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY, ALONG WITH OTHER MATTERS IN THIS PROSPECTUS, THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE, IN ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS, BEFORE MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR OUR IPO SHARES. (p. 195)\\n\\n## 9.1 Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations (p. 195)\\n\\n- **(i) We are dependent on some of our Strategic Partners** (p. 195)\\n\\n  We are dependent on our Strategic Partners, namely Starza, Juricco and Haynik, to deliver ICT Solutions to Government-linked corporations and agencies. These Strategic Partners were consistently ranked as part of our top 5 customers during each of the Financial Years/Period Under Review. Collectively, they contributed 77.01%, 76.26%, 77.38% and 77.69% of our revenue in the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. Please refer to Section 7.14 of this Prospectus for the detailed breakdown of the purchases from these companies during the Financial Years/Period Under Review.\\n\\n  As such, we are exposed to risks that if we fail to secure additional orders or contracts with them in the future or encounter delays in payments or non-payments from end-users of orders and contracts secured through these Strategic Partners. Should this occur, this may adversely affect our Group\\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\\n\\n  Pursuant to the terms of the strategic partnership agreements entered with these Strategic Partners (as detailed in Section 7.25 of this Prospectus), we leverage on these Strategic Partners\\u2019 continued support in distributing and promoting our ICT Solutions through our exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Meanwhile, our Strategic Partners rely on us to provide:\\n\\n  - (i) a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions with options to finance their purchase through renting or leasing with us via our technology financing solution orders or contracts; and\\n\\n  - (ii) better pricing and terms for their customers as we are able to negotiate pricing and terms directly with the Principals as we are the Appointed Resellers of several established Principals.\\n\\n  Although our relationship with these Strategic Partners are mutually beneficial, we are exposed to risks that these Strategic Partners may terminate their strategic partnership agreements with us. For information, there is also no specific termination and default clauses provided in the strategic partnership agreements with these Strategic Partners which provide that the agreements shall continue to be in force until terminated by mutual agreement. Should this occur, this may adversely affect our Group\\u2019s business operations and financial performance as a substantial percentage of our Group\\u2019s revenues were generated from these Strategic Partners during the Financial Years/Period Under Review. The extent of this impact will depend on our ability to channel our resources to secure other customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n  Further, a significant amount of our order book for our technology financing are presently generated from these Strategic Partners. As at the LPD, RM179.61 million or 75.92% of the total order book for technology financing amounting to RM236.57 million is contributed by the Strategic Partners.\\n\\n  Thus, if any of these customers cease to be a Strategic Partner, there may be a potential revenue loss to our Group and a negative impact on our orderbook. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the business relationship, secure future orders or contracts, or receive prompt payments from the end-users of orders or contracts secured through them.\\n\\n- **(ii) Our growth depends on our ability to secure and renew orders and contracts** (p. 196)\\n\\n  Due to the nature of our business operations, our future growth, financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to consistently secure orders and contracts from existing and new customers for the provision of ICT Solutions.\\n\\n  Our technology financing solution order and contract tenure may be up to 5 years. Meanwhile, our ICT services and cloud solutions and services may either be secured on a contract basis which spans up to 5 years, or secured on a purchase order basis. Any difficulties in securing new customers, or renewal or additional orders or contracts from existing customers, in a timely manner may adversely affect our business and financial performance. As at the LPD, our order book stood at RM242.81 million.\\n\\n  We do not enter into long-term contracts with our clients for our implementation services due to the rapid technological changes and market trends of the industry in which our clients operate in. As for our maintenance, support and professional services contracts, the tenure of the contracts is slightly longer, but we are subject to termination or reduction of our services by the clients in the event that there are changes to the clients\\u2019 strategies or changes in the enterprise IT solutions required for their operations.\\n\\n  Further, the volume and size of orders or contracts are subject to several factors, which include, among others, economic downturns, industry-specific slowdowns and customers\\u2019 financial constraints. Should we be unable to secure new orders and contracts of similar or greater volume and size, our financial performance may also be adversely impacted.\\n\\n- **(iii) Our technology financing solution business is capital intensive** (p. 196)\\n\\n  Our technology financing solution business requires financial capital for the purchase of ICT hardware and software to be leased or rented. As such, the prospective growth of our technology financing solution business is dependent on, amongst others, our ability to secure additional funding and financing to support our additional capital requirements. If we are unable to secure additional funding and financing or if such additional funding and financing is only available on terms that are less favourable than the terms of our current capital, our ability to grow our technology financing solution business may be adversely impacted.\\n\\n  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our financial capital was mainly funded and financed by multiple sources of capital, amongst others, our Group\\u2019s internally generated funds and bank borrowings obtained from the financial institutions and leasing companies, as well as capital raised from equity capital market in the Private Placement. Please refer to Section 12.6 of this Prospectus for details of the sources of funds for our financial capital over the Financial Years/Period Under Review.\\n\\n  We have also allocated RM18.50 million of our IPO Proceeds to purchase ICT hardware and software for our technology financing solution business. Please refer to Section 4.8 of this Prospectus for details of the utilisation of our IPO Proceeds.\\n\\n  Our ability to obtain additional funding and financing and the costs of capital of such funding and financing are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions, monetary and fiscal policies as determined by the Government, credit availability from financial institutions, cost of financing of financial institutions, our continued success of operations as well as our financial performance and position. If we are unable to raise adequate funding and financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, growth, operations and prospects could be adversely affected. (p. 196)\\n\\n  There is no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to purchase the ICT hardware and software required to expand our technology financing solution business in the future. (p. 197)\\n\\n- **(iv) We face credit and liquidity risks if there are delays in collection or non recoverability of trade receivables** (p. 197)\\n\\n  The customers and/or end-users of our technology financing solutions and cloud solutions and services segments are required to pay rental fees, leasing fees, cloud platform rental fees or cloud solution fees on a monthly basis. Generally, we grant credit terms of up to 60 days to our customers. Other credit terms are assessed and approved on a case-by case basis after taking into consideration various factors such as our customers\\u2019 historical payment trend, creditworthiness, the quantum of the amount owed, and the length of their business relationship with us.\\n\\n  As such, we are exposed to risks of delays in collection or non-recoverability of our trade receivables. Should this occur, we may have to make an allowance for doubtful debts or write off bad debts, which may adversely impact our financial performance and position.\\n\\n  As our business requires substantial financial capital to purchase ICT hardware and software, our Group\\u2019s liquidity is dependent on our ability to manage our financial capital. If we receive an increase in demand for technology financing solutions and/or cloud solutions and services from customers, a delay in collection or non-recoverability of trade receivables may restrict our ability to pursue such business opportunities.\\n\\n  As at 30 November 2024, RM2.72 million or 20.67% of our trade receivables were past the credit period granted to our customers. During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, we did not experience any delay in collection or non-recoverability of trade receivables that had a material adverse impact on our Group\\u2019s financial performance.\\n\\n  Despite the above, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience minimal payment delays and recover all past-due trade receivables, which would significantly impact our Group\\u2019s financial performance and position.\\n\\n- **(v) Our business could suffer if we are unable to recruit and retain our key senior management personnel and qualified technical personnel** (p. 197)\\n\\n  Our success and future growth will depend on the expertise and continuing efforts of our key senior management, namely our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang; our Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Vincent Ng Soon Kiat; our General Manager, Admin and Finance, Teh Siow Voon; our Accountant, Cheah Chin Mon; our Assistant General Manager, Operations Support, Lau Yeo Chuan; and Chief Executive Officer of HaaS, Loh Kuo Hsiung.\\n\\n  Our key senior management team has extensive experience across a broad spectrum of business activities, from operations to finance to sales and marketing. Their experience, drive and passion for our business have been instrumental to our Group\\u2019s vision and growth strategies.\\n\\n  As such, a loss of our key senior management without suitable and timely replacement may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial performance and position. Although we have put in place management succession plans, as detailed in Section 5.9 of the Prospectus, there can be no assurance that the loss of our key senior management will not adversely and materially impact our Group\\u2019s business, prospects, financial performance and position. (p. 197)\\n\\n  In addition, our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with the right technical expertise, professional integrity and commitment. There is no assurance that our present efforts in recruiting and retaining talent will result in the successful recruitment and retention of our suitable qualified employees. The potential loss of these personnel and our inability to promptly secure suitable replacements could disrupt our deliverables to our customers. Further, if we lose our employees to our competitors, our competitiveness, business operations and ability to grow may also be adversely affected. (p. 198)\\n\\n- **(vi) Our technology financing solution business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates** (p. 198)\\n\\n  As a large portion of our Group\\u2019s working capital is sourced from local financial institutions, our borrowing cost is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates. As at the LPD, our Group\\u2019s total outstanding bank borrowings was RM99.85 million, all of which are based on a floating interest rate.\\n\\n  Our Group\\u2019s borrowing cost is thus dependent on interest rates imposed by financial institutions which, in turn, are guided by prevailing monetary policy and OPR imposed by the Bank Negara Malaysia. An increase in interest rates imposed will lead to an increase in our Group\\u2019s borrowing cost and vice versa.\\n\\n  Based on our Group\\u2019s total outstanding bank borrowings of RM99.85 million as at the LPD, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rate would lead to an increase in interests of approximately RM1.00 million per annum, assuming all other variables are constant.\\n\\n  There is no assurance that our financial performance will not impacted by substantial changes in interest rates of our bank borrowings.\\n\\n- **(vii) Our refurbished ICT hardware may become obsolete** (p. 198)\\n\\n  ICT hardware manufacturers and semiconductor design houses constantly develop new product designs to keep up with changing market trends and remain relevant in the ICT industry. In doing so, new ICT hardware models with more advanced specifications are constantly being introduced into the market. An introduction of a new ICT hardware model with more advanced specifications could reduce the prices of preceding ICT hardware models, or result in obsolesces of the preceding ICT hardware models.\\n\\n  While we keep abreast with the latest technological changes relevant to our industry, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate an introduction of a new ICT hardware model with more advanced specifications which would render the ICT hardware models we have refurbished for rental or lease to our customers obsolete or reduce the demand for these refurbished ICT hardware. Should these refurbished ICT hardware be deemed obsolete, or should there be lower demand for the ICT hardware models due to the introduction of a more advanced ICT hardware model, we will have to dispose or sell the refurbished ICT hardware. In the event we have to dispose or sell these refurbished ICT hardware below its net book value, this could result in losses, which would adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\\n\\n  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, the Group registered a loss on the disposal of ICT hardware of RM45,440, RM95,106, RM20,390 and RM54,552 in FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. Although these losses did not have a material adverse impact on our Group\\u2019s financial performance during the Financial Years/Period Under Review, there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses that could materially and adversely impact our Group\\u2019s financial performance in the future.\\n\\n- **(viii) Inadequacy of insurance coverage may cause significant loss and damage to us** (p. 199)\\n\\n  We maintain insurance at levels that are customary in our industry to protect against various losses and liabilities, such as fire, burglary and personal accident insurance arising from our business operations.\\n\\n  We also procure insurance for all of our ICT hardware that are leased or rented. This allows us to claim for risks relating to the ICT hardware including damage, stolen or lost ICT hardware, subject to the terms of the insurance policy.\\n\\n  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, there were no insurance claims that have materially impacted our financial performance and position.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding, our financial performance may be adversely impacted if we incur substantial losses that are in excess of our insured sums or the losses incurred are not covered under our insurance policies. In addition, these insurance coverages are prone to exclusions and limitations of liability both in the amount and with respect to the insured events.\\n\\n  In the event our losses exceed the insurance coverage or are not covered by our insurance policy, and we are unable to claim these losses from our customer and/or end-user, we may be required to bear such losses. Consequently, our financial performance and position may be adversely impacted. Further, the insurance coverage is subject to annual renewal, and there is no assurance that we will be able to renew or procure new insurance policies on favourable terms and at premiums acceptable to us.\\n\\n- **(ix) We may face risks of security breaches** (p. 199)\\n\\n  In the course of providing cloud solutions and services, with the consent of our customers, we may have access to customers\\u2019 confidential information, including information on their ICT policies and ICT systems. In addition, we also subscribe to cloud solutions provided by our Principals and/or Principals\\u2019 Distributors.\\n\\n  As such, we may face risks of external security threats and internal security breaches which could result in a breach of customers\\u2019 confidential information or breach of these cloud solutions which we subscribe to. External security threats include malware attacks, hacking, espionage and cyber intrusion. Meanwhile, internal security breaches include unauthorised access to restricted information by employees or attacks that originate from malware-infected devices that are brought into the network system by employees. Any such security attacks and breaches can compromise the security of our ICT infrastructure and data.\\n\\n  Since our commencement of business till the LPD, there have been no incidents of security attacks and breaches that have materially and adversely affected our business operations. However, despite this, there is no guarantee that our internal ICT infrastructure and data will not be subject to inadvertent conduct (which may arise from software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee error or misconduct, amongst others), unauthorised disclosure or loss of personal or confidential information, or security breaches by third parties.\\n\\n  Further, we implement cloud solutions and services, which involve implementing IaaS and PaaS based on private, public or hybrid cloud deployment models. Although our cloud solutions and services are sourced from Principals and Principal\\u2019s Distributors, and our scope of work is limited to the implementation of these cloud solutions and services and does not encompass the design of our customers\\u2019 security infrastructure, we could be perceived to be responsible should there be any security breaches to the cloud infrastructure implemented for customers. (p. 199)\\n\\n  Any data leakage or loss of data or cybersecurity breaches to our customers\\u2019 data and ICT infrastructures or as a result of the provision of our services, or breaches to our Principal\\u2019s and/or Principals\\u2019 solutions, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect the market perception of our services. This, in turn, may damage our Group\\u2019s reputation. If any such incident relating to the leakage or loss of confidential information of our customers is by us, this could expose us to significant liability if we are subject to litigation or other action resulting in monetary damages and legal fees. (p. 200)\\n\\n  As a result, we may incur additional costs in defending any claims, and this could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For the Financial Years/Period Under Review and up to the LPD, there have not been any claims made against us in respect of security breaches. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to any security breaches in the future, which may adversely affect our reputation and financial performance.\\n\\n  In particular, Rhipe Malaysia Sdn Bhd (\\u201cRhipe\\u201d) who is an authorised distributor of Microsoft products to whom we have paid a subscription fee for the use of the Microsoft Azure solution, had notified our Group of high consumption of the said solution in November 2022 though we have ceased subscribing to the solution post-October 2022. The high consumption of the solution was likely due to a breach of security. Although our Group was not responsible for the use of the said solution, we had received a letter of demand from Rhipe for the payment of an alleged sum of RM2.17 million being the outstanding sum due and payable for providing Microsoft Azure cloud services to us.\\n\\n  We have since responded to the letter of demand on 15 September 2023 stating we have no knowledge of the allegations therein and denying these claims by Rhipe. We have also issued a letter to request for discovery against Rhipe seeking clarification on pertinent matters relating to their claim. As at the LPD, we have not received any additional letter of demand or court summons from Rhipe or its solicitors to claim for the alleged outstanding sums due and payable for the Services, nor have we received any response to our respective letters to Rhipe.\\n\\n  Should the case continue, we may be liable to pay for charges of use of the Services up to 5 December 2022, when Rhipe ought to have suspended the subscription of the solution. As our Group is unable to obtain the breakdown for the utilisation up to 5 December 2022, our Group is unable to quantify the charges of use of the Services up to 5 December 2022. However, should we be liable to pay for these charges, we may incur a cost of up to RM2.17 million, which may impact our financial performance. Our financial performance could also be adversely impacted if we have to incur additional costs in defending any claims.\\n\\n## 9.2 Risks Relating to Our Industry (p. 201)\\n\\n- **(i) We face competition in our industry** (p. 201)\\n\\n  We face competition from ICT Solution providers in Malaysia and potential new entrants in the industry. Increased competition has, and will continue to have, an impact on our ability to retain our existing customers and secure new customers, and this may adversely affect our Group\\u2019s operational results and financial performance.\\n\\n  Our Group generally offers similar products as our competitors, i.e. ICT hardware and software on a lease or rental basis. We generally compete with other competitors in terms of our ability to offer a range of ICT Solution brands and timeliness of delivery. Our competitiveness is also dependent on our ability to maintain our service level and uphold our reputation in the industry.\\n\\n  Further, we may also compete with existing and new entrants who adopt aggressive pricing strategies and offer more attractive sales terms, which may result in stiffer competition and a reduction of our market share in the ICT Solution industry. If we are unable to remain competitive and adapt to industry changes, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\\n\\n- **(ii) We are exposed to the risk of supply disruption of ICT hardware resulting from global shortages of semiconductors** (p. 201)\\n\\n  Semiconductors are an integral part of the manufacturing of ICT hardware, which is also an important part of implementing our ICT Solutions.\\n\\n  There was a global shortage of semiconductors, as fabrication activities were disrupted when foundries could not operate due to national lockdowns and the imposition of tariff barriers restricting companies in the United States of America (\\u201cUnited States\\u201d) and the People\\u2019s Republic of China (\\u201cChina\\u201d) from trading. The higher demand for electronic products further exacerbated the shortage of semiconductors globally.\\n\\n  Further, the Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, also exacerbated the shortage of microchips globally. Both Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of palladium and neon, which are raw materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. While foundries have stocked up on these materials, a prolonged war affected the supply of semiconductors globally, which consequently had an adverse impact on the manufacturing of ICT hardware.\\n\\n  The on-going trade sanctions between the United States and China resulted in the United States imposing export controls on certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment to companies based in China. This has hindered companies in China from producing advanced semiconductor products, thus affecting the availability of semiconductors worldwide. Further, the imposition of tariffs on semiconductor products and raw materials between the United States and China has increased the cost of importing and exporting semiconductor products, causing prices of consumer products, such as ICT hardware to increase.\\n\\n  While our Group has experienced delays in receiving supplies of ICT hardware in the past, we have not experienced any material adverse impact on our financial performance due to such disruptions in supplies of ICT hardware. However, there can be no assurance that any future disruption in the supply of ICT hardware will not have a negative impact on our Group\\u2019s financial performance.\\n\\n- **(iii) We are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks** (p. 202)\\n\\n  Our business is subject to the risks associated with conducting business in Malaysia because we mainly sell our ICT Solutions to customers within Malaysia and purchase ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud subscriptions from local suppliers.\\n\\n  Notwithstanding that we principally operate in Malaysia, we derive a portion, albeit a small percentage of our revenue, from other countries. For the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our revenue generated from international markets accounted for approximately 0.06%, 0.07%, 0.03% and 1.13%, respectively. We may also obtain cloud subscriptions directly from Principals, who are based in international markets.\\n\\n  We are thus susceptible to legal, regulatory, political and economic conditions as well as operational risks in Malaysia and other countries. As we continue to expand our business, our financial performance and position could be affected by a variety of factors, including:\\n\\n  (a) political and economic instability, including global and regional macroeconomic disruptions such as natural calamities, epidemics or other risks related to countries where we procure our ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud subscriptions, or sell our ICT Solutions;\\n\\n  (b) unfavourable changes in government policies such as the introduction of new regulations, including trade protection measures, sanctions, import or export restrictions and licencing regulations, duties, tariffs or subsidies; and\\n\\n  (c) risks related to social and political crises resulting from riots, terrorism, war or civil unrest, amongst others.\\n\\n  There can be no assurance that any adverse legal, regulatory, political or economic conditions will not materially affect our Group\\u2019s future financial performance.\\n\\n## 9.3 Risks Relating to Investment in Our Shares (p. 203)\\n\\n- **(i) No prior market for our Shares on the ACE Market and it is uncertain whether a sustainable market for our Shares on the ACE Market will ever develop** (p. 203)\\n\\n  Before our Transfer of Listing and IPO, there has been no prior market for our Shares on the ACE Market. Hence, there is no assurance that upon Listing, an active market for our Shares will develop, or if developed, that such a market will be sustainable. There is also no assurance as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for our Shares, the ability of holders to sell our Shares or the selling prices at which holders would be able to sell our Shares.\\n\\n  We and our Promoters have no obligation to make our Shares marketable. The IPO Price was determined after taking into consideration various factors, and these factors could cause our Share price to fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our Shares.\\n\\n  There can be no assurance that the IPO Price will correspond to the price at which our Shares will trade on the ACE Market upon our Listing and that the market price of our Shares will not decline below the IPO Price.\\n\\n- **(ii) Capital market risks and share price volatility** (p. 203)\\n\\n  The performance of the capital market is very much dependent on external factors such as the performance of the regional and global stock markets and the inflow or outflow of foreign funds. Sentiment is also largely driven by internal factors such as the economic and political conditions of the country as well as the growth potential of the various sectors of the economy. These factors invariably contribute to the volatility of trading volumes in the capital market, thus adding risks to the market price of our listed Shares. Nevertheless, the profitability of our Group is not dependent on the performance of the capital market, as the business activities of our Group have no direct correlation with the performance of securities listed in the capital market.\\n\\n  Our Shares could trade at prices lower than the IPO Price depending on various factors, including current economic, financial and fiscal conditions in Malaysia, our operations and financial results and the price volatility in the markets for securities in similar or related industries in Malaysia or emerging markets. There is no assurance that any market for our Shares will not be disrupted by price volatility or other factors, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Shares.\\n\\n  In addition, the market price of our Shares may be highly volatile. It could fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, amongst others, the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\\n\\n  (a) variation in our results and operations;\\n\\n  (b) success or failure of our management team in implementing business and growth strategies;\\n\\n  (c) changes in securities analysts\\u2019 recommendations, perceptions or estimates of our financial performance;\\n\\n  (d) changes in conditions affecting the industry, the general economic conditions or stock market sentiments or other events and factors;\\n\\n  (e) additions or departures of our Key Senior Management team;\\n\\n  (f) fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; or (p. 203)\\n\\n  (g) involvement in litigation. (p. 204)\\n\\n  In addition, many of the risks described herein could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Shares. Furthermore, if the trading volume of our Shares is low, price fluctuation may be exacerbated. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our Shares will not trade lower than the IPO Price.\\n\\n- **(iii) Our Promoters will be able to exert significant influence over our Company as they will continue to hold a majority of our Shares after the IPO** (p. 204)\\n\\n  As disclosed in Section 5.1.1 of this Prospectus, our Promoters will collectively hold in aggregate 51.85% of our enlarged issued share capital after our Listing. As a result, they will be able to, in the foreseeable future, effectively control the business direction and management of our Group as well as have voting control over our Group and, as such, will likely influence the outcome of certain matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, unless they are required to abstain from voting either by law and/or by the relevant guidelines or regulations. There can be no assurance that the interests of our Promoters will be aligned with those of our other shareholders.\\n\\n- **(iv) The sale or the possible sale of a substantial number of Shares in the public market following our IPO could adversely affect the price of our Shares** (p. 204)\\n\\n  Following the completion of our IPO and Listing, approximately 37.88% of our enlarged issued share capital will be publicly held by investors participating in our IPO, while approximately 51.85% of our enlarged issued share capital, will be held by our Promoters.\\n\\n  Our Promoters may dispose of some or all of their Shares after their respective moratorium period, pursuant to their investment objectives. If our Promoters and substantial shareholders sell or are perceived as intending to sell a substantial amount of our Shares, the market price of our Shares could be adversely affected.\\n\\n- **(v) Delay in or cancellation of our Listing** (p. 204)\\n\\n  The occurrence of certain events, including the following, may cause a delay in or termination of our Listing:\\n\\n  (a) our Joint Underwriters exercising their rights pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to discharge themselves from their obligations under such agreement;\\n\\n  (b) our inability to meet the minimum public spread requirement under the ACE LR of having at least 25.00% of the total number of our Shares for which our Listing is sought being in the hands of at least 200 public shareholders holding at least 100 Shares each at the point of our Listing; or\\n\\n  (c) the revocation of the approvals from the relevant authorities for our Listing for whatever reason.\\n\\n  Where before the issuance and allotment of our IPO Shares: (p. 204)\\n\\n  (a) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245(1) of the CMSA, the applications shall be deemed to be withdrawn and cancelled, and our Company shall repay all monies paid in respect of the applications for our IPO Shares within 14 days of the stop order, failing which we shall be liable to return such monies with interest at the rate of 10.00% per annum or such other rate as may be specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(a) of the CMSA; or (p. 204)\\n\\n  (b) our Listing is aborted, investors will not receive any of our IPO Shares, and all monies paid in respect to all applications for our IPO Shares will be refunded free of interest within 14 days. (p. 205)\\n\\n  Where subsequent to the issuance and allotment of our IPO Shares: (p. 205)\\n\\n  (a) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245(1) of the CMSA, any issue of our IPO Shares shall be deemed to be void, and all monies received from the applicants shall be forthwith repaid, and if any such money is not repaid within 14 days of the date of service of the stop order, we shall be liable to return such monies with interest at the rate of 10.00% per annum or such other rate as may be specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(b) of the CMSA; or\\n\\n  (b) our Listing is aborted other than pursuant to a stop order by the SC under Section 245(1) of the CMSA, a return of monies to our shareholders could only be achieved by way of cancellation of share capital as provided under the Act and its related rules to the extent that our IPO Shares form part of our share capital. Such cancellation can be implemented by the sanction of our shareholders by special resolution in a general meeting and supported by either (aa) consent by our creditors (unless dispensation with such consent has been granted by the High Court of Malaya) and the confirmation of the High Court of Malaya, in which case there can be no assurance that such monies can be returned within a short period of time or at all under such circumstances, or (bb) a solvency statement from the directors.\\n\\n- **(vi) Payment of dividends** (p. 205)\\n\\n  Our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders will depend on, amongst others, our future financial performance, distributable reserves and cash flows. This, in turn, is dependent on our operating results, capital requirements and our ability to implement our future plans, demand for and selling prices of our products, general economic conditions, and other factors specific to our industry, many of which are beyond our control. As such, there is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends to our shareholders.\\n\\n  We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, dividends and other distributions received from our subsidiaries are our principal source of income. The receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries may also be affected by the passage of new laws, adoption of new regulations and other events outside our control, and our subsidiaries may not continue to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements for the payment of dividends in the future. In addition, changes in accounting standards may also affect the ability of our subsidiaries and, consequently, our ability to pay dividends.\\n\\n  Further, our payment of dividends may adversely affect our ability to fund unexpected capital expenditure as well as our ability to make interest and principal repayments on any borrowings that we may have outstanding at the time. As a result, we may be required to borrow additional money or raise capital by issuing equity securities, which may not be on favourable terms or available at all. Further, if we incur new borrowings subsequent to our Listing, we may be subject to additional covenants restricting our ability to pay dividends.\\n\\n  Our Board intends to recommend and distribute a dividend of up to 20.00% of the annual audited profit attributable to the owners of our Company after our Listing. However, dividend payments will depend on our ability to pay dividends and could not be guaranteed, and our Board may decide, at its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason, not to pay dividends. If we do not pay dividends or pay dividends at levels lower than that anticipated by investors, the market price of our Shares may be negatively affected, and the value of any investment in our Shares may be reduced.\\n\\n  Further details of our dividend policy are set out in Section 12.13 of this Prospectus.\",\n",

This translates to a P/E Multiple of 18.02 times at our IPO price;\\n\\n(b) an EPS of 0.92 sen, computed based on our Group\\u2019s audited FYE 2024 PAT attributable to owners of our Company of RM7.34 million and the total enlarged issued share capital of 795,453,200 Shares (assuming Public Issue of 133,000,000 Issue Shares pursuant to our IPO). This translates to a P/E Multiple of 21.74 times at our IPO price; and\\n\\n(c) an EBITDA of RM48.17 million with an enterprise value (\\u201cEV\\u201d) of RM220.41 million calculated based on the total enlarged issued share capital of 795,453,200 Shares (assuming Public Issue of 133,000,000 Issue Shares pursuant to our IPO). This translates to an EV/EBITDA Multiple of 4.58 times. For your information, our Group\\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple before and after our IPO remains the same as the EV is computed based on market capitalisation adjusted for cash (including the proceeds to be raised from the Public Issue), borrowings and non-controlling interests.\\n\\nOur detailed operating and historical financial performance are set out in Section 7.3 and Section 12.2 of this Prospectus, respectively.\\n\\nTo ensure there is a clear price discovery mechanism for our IPO Price, peer analysis has been carried out to benchmark the P/E Multiple and EV/EBITDA Multiple implied by our IPO Price against the P/E Multiple and EV/EBITDA Multiple of comparable companies in similar industry and/or business activities as our Company by Malacca Securities and SCS Global.

Hence, if the allocated proceeds are insufficient to fund the actual amount, we will fund the shortfall by using our internally generated funds and/or bank borrowings. Any surplus from the allocated proceeds will be used for expansion of our technology financing solutions business purposes.\\n\\nPending the utilisation of the proceeds raised from our Public Issue, the proceeds raised will be placed in interest-bearing short-term deposits or money market instruments with licensed financial institutions. The interest derived or any gain arising therefrom will be used for our working capital requirements (such as expenses for utilities, staff costs, and rental payment for offices), the breakdown of which cannot be determined at this juncture, as it depends on our working capital requirements at that point in time. The Board intends to utilise the interest derived or the gain arising therefrom within 6 months from the receipt of such interest/gain.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n(i) Expansion of the technology financing solutions business\\n\\nTo expand our technology financing solutions business organically as well as to cater for and capture increasing demand from our customers, we intend to allocate RM21.00 million or 78.95% of the total gross proceeds to be raised from our Public Issue to finance the expansion of our technology financing solutions business in the following manner:\\n\\nTable: [no title] (p. 34)\\n- Details: Purchase of ICT hardware and software for technology financing solutions business(a); RM\\u2019000: 18,500\\n- Details: Other operating expenses(b); RM\\u2019000: 2,500\\n- Details: Total; RM\\u2019000: 21,000\\n\\nNotes: (p. 35)\\n\\n(a) The proceeds allocated will be utilised to purchase ICT hardware and software to support our technology financing solutions business. The ICT hardware includes purchasing approximately 4,000 units of computers and laptops together with a corresponding number of related peripheral devices such as mice, keyboards, monitors and security locks. The ICT software includes operating systems, device management and computer security software that protects the ICT Solutions against computer viruses, malware, spyware and/or adware. The ICT software purchased from third party providers will be bundled with the ICT hardware to meet our customer\\u2019s needs and requirements. We intend to utilise RM18.50 million of the proceeds in the following manner:\\n\\nTable: [no title] (p. 35)\\n- Description: Computers and laptops (together with related peripheral devices); No. of units: 4,000; Estimated cost per unit (RM): 4,000; Total estimated cost (RM\\u2019000): 16,000\\n- Description: ICT software; No. of units: 4,000; Estimated cost per unit (RM): 625; Total estimated cost (RM\\u2019000): 2,500\\n- Description: Total; No. of units: [empty]; Estimated cost per unit (RM): [empty]; Total estimated cost (RM\\u2019000): 18,500\\n\\nThese bundled ICT Solutions encompass proactive and analytical services, remote managed services, device recovery services and CNCS, which are expected to enhance their management and monitoring capabilities over ICT Solutions. The number of units of hardware and software stated above is based on our management\\u2019s estimate. The actual number of units to be purchased is subject to the prevailing market price of the ICT hardware and software at the point of purchase.\\n\\n(b) The proceeds allocated for other operating expenses to facilitate our technology financing solutions business expansion are proposed to be utilised as follows:\\n\\nTable: [no title] (p. 35)\\n- Details: Finance costs(1); RM\\u2019000: 1,143\\n- Details: Legal fees(2); RM\\u2019000: 750\\n- Details: Insurance expenses(3); RM\\u2019000: 607\\n- Details: Total; RM\\u2019000: 2,500\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n(1) Finance Costs\\nTo enable our Group to leverage debt financing to grow our business, we procure debt financing from financial institutions to purchase ICT Solutions upon entering into new technology financing solutions orders/contracts. As such, we will incur finance costs such as processing fees, brokerage fees and other fees/incidental expenses when obtaining the debt financing facilities from financial institutions. In addition, we are required to place a principal amount of up to 2 months of instalment with the financial institutions to obtain the debt financing facilities. For avoidance of doubt, the gross proceeds allocated for finance costs are not for our Group\\u2019s existing bank borrowings and interest payment, and thus will not result in any savings in interest expenses for our Group.\\n\\n(2) Legal fees (p. 36)\\nWe entered into leasing and rental orders/contracts with our customers and financing agreements with the financial institutions for our technology financing business. As such, we are required to incur professional fees and stamp duty associated with executing these agreements.\\n\\n(3) Insurance expenses (p. 36)\\nWe purchase equipment-all-risks insurance policies for our ICT hardware leased or rented out. Such insurance coverage covers loss of or damage to the ICT hardware leased or rented out as a result of events, amongst others, fire, theft or any accidental damage during the period of the insurance. The insurance coverage on ICT hardware serves to mitigate potential business operation risks and losses that result from the loss or damage of the insured ICT hardware and safeguard the value of the insured ICT hardware in case of loss or damage. It is also often required by the financial institutions as a condition of the debt financing agreement.\\n\\n(ii) Sales and marketing expenditures (p. 36)\\nTo increase our Group\\u2019s market visibility and brand recognition, we intend to allocate RM1.50 million or 5.64% of the total gross proceeds to be raised from our Public Issue to finance our Group\\u2019s sales and marketing expenditures, which include, amongst others, the following:\\n\\nTable: [no title] (p. 36)\\n- Details: Staff costs(a); RM\\u2019000: 1,170\\n- Details: Marketing activities(b); RM\\u2019000: 330\\n- Details: Total; RM\\u2019000: 1,500\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n(a) Our Group intends to employ up to 7 new permanent sales and marketing personnel to support our sales and marketing activities. The new hires will span various roles, from executive to senior management level, with monthly staff costs ranging from RM6,000 to RM19,000 per employee.\\n\\nThe staff costs mainly consist of salaries, staff benefits, training and development expenses, medical expenses and other expenses in relation to our human resources for a period of 18 months beginning from the date of employment of the respective staff.\\n\\n(b) We intend to utilise RM0.33 million of the proceeds to further enhance our existing marketing activities which comprise, amongst others, digital marketing efforts on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok, as well as search engine marketing on Google and Bing. We plan to increase the advertising frequency in the social media platforms, subscribe for higher search engine marketing campaigns to boost our website\\u2019s visibility through the right keywords and run advertisement on search engines. In addition, we intend to invest in amongst others, media advertising, telemarketing, email marketing, event marketing and content marketing strategies.\\n\\n(iii) Estimated listing expenses for the Transfer of Listing (p. 37)\\nAn amount of RM4.10 million is allocated to meet the estimated cost of the Transfer of Listing.

We recognise the growing need for corporations and associations to monitor the usage and status of ICT hardware and software as well as ICT maintenance and technical support services (\\u201cICT Solutions\\u201d) to effectively manage their assets and avoid any potential operational disruptions. We also acknowledge the need for customers\\u2019 assurance of permanent data removal from ICT hardware after the rental period is completed or the device is disposed. We believe these products, which will be procured from third party providers, will add value to our existing ICT Solutions as they enable us to offer our customers the ability to better manage and monitor the ICT Solutions rented, leased or procured from us. As an illustration, device management software can identify any potential technical issues with an ICT hardware and alert users to make the necessary ICT hardware replacement if required. Meanwhile, the computer security software will assist us to provide our customers with added assurance of permanent data removal of all ICT Solutions through a certified and secured data removal process before its usage in a company is terminated as compared to the current process of reformatting all ICT hardware after the expiry of the rental/leasing period. As such, we have been creating awareness of the benefits of device management software and computer security software to our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to gauge the market acceptance of these products. Moving forward, we intend to grow our revenue stream from these products by actively marketing to both our existing and potential end-user customers. In particular, we will be marketing these products to private corporations such as Small and medium-sized enterprises (\\u201cSMEs\\u201d) and large corporations. We also intend to undertake online advertising and set up a dedicated website to promote these products. Further, we plan to organise events and participate in events to create awareness of these products. The cost for these marketing activities over the span of 1 year is expected to be approximately RM50,000, which will be funded via internally generated funds.; Current Status or Progress: Since our listing on the LEAP Market, our Group has begun offering device management and computer security software to enhance the value of our Group\\u2019s technology financing solutions business. In particular, our Group has begun offering the following value-added services by sourcing device management and computer security software from third-party ICT Solutions providers since 2021: (i) proactive and analytics service to monitor and predict device health in term of: (a) inventory and asset management, which allows for monitoring of devices where details (such as utilisation and warranty) for all devices are illustrated on a single dashboard; (b) device proactive incident management, which predicts and prevents technical issues concerning the devices by monitoring the condition of the devices. This allows for planning and prompt resolution(s) of technical issues; (c) device performance and health analytical management, which analyses device performance with proactive insights and reports to anticipate the needs of service or maintenance and easy device management; and (d) device security and user management, which manage users with attached devices and monitor device usage by user(s); and (ii) permanent data removal service, which produces an auditable and digitally signed certificate as proof that customers\\u2019 device\\u2019s data has been 100% erased after the leasing/rental period or when the ICT hardware is disposed of. From FYE 2022 to FYE 2024, our Group utilised RM51,000 to undertake initiatives such as campaigns or content marketing with Microsoft and Principals (RM25,000), as well as webinars and events hosted by media to promote the abovementioned value-added services (RM26,000). As such, the budgeted expenses for such marketing activities had been fully utilised. In 2021, our Group launched Device-as-a-Service (\\u201cDaaS\\u201d) 360 in a subscription model, which comprises life cycle management and device recovery services with financial solutions. DaaS 360 enables enterprises to optimise the usage of ICT hardware and supports as well as repurpose and reuse old ICT hardware, thereby reducing the number of ICT hardware wasted after their life cycle ends. The DaaS 360 has been certified with the MyHIJAU mark, a green recognition scheme endorsed by the Government. Our Group\\u2019s efforts in marketing the abovementioned services have been concentrated on creating awareness among our Group\\u2019s Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to gauge market acceptance. The introduction of these software serves to enhance the value proposition of our Group\\u2019s products offerings, thereby increasing the demand for our Group\\u2019s products. Our Group has also been developing marketing strategies to further capitalise on this opportunity by way of, amongst others, online advertising via a dedicated website (i.e. https://daas.my/) which went live in June 2022, social media or social networking platforms (i.e. TikTok and LinkedIn), and participation in events (such as Microsoft 365 DaaS Seminar 2022, HP DaaS Seminar 2022, SME Growth Summit 2023 and Top in Tech Talk Series Webinar 2023) and/or tenders (or presentation, as the case may be) to corporations and Government associations via our Group\\u2019s Channel Partners and/or Strategic Partners to promote these products to both existing and potential end-user customers, particularly within the private sector, including SMEs and large corporations. We propose to allocate part of the proceeds to be raised from the Public Issue to fund these marketing activities over the next few years.\\n- Section: (ii); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: We intend to offer our new and existing customers a new option for financing ICT Solutions We presently offer our customers the option to rent, lease or purchase ICT Solutions. Moving forward, we intend to enable the purchase of ICT Solutions through factoring financing. Factoring financing refers to short-term financing offered by our Group to finance invoices relating to ICT Solutions purchases by our customers. Through our past experience in the ICT industry, we understand that our Channel Partners commonly face cash flow constraints when acquiring ICT Solutions for their onward sale to their customers. With factoring financing, we will be able to provide capital to our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners for the purchase of ICT Solutions. This would also benefit our trading segment as it will ease the outright purchase of ICT Solutions. We are currently finalising our arrangements with stakeholders such as financial institutions as well as our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to facilitate this new business model. We plan to finalise the arrangements and launch this business model before the end of 2022.; Current Status or Progress: We have been constantly monitoring the evolving technology financing needs and have focused our efforts on bundling our technology financing solutions with other ICT products or offerings to meet our customers\\u2019 needs and demands. Correspondingly, our Group\\u2019s revenue increased from RM39.56 million for the FYE 2021 to RM114.43 million for the FYE 2024. Having observed significant growth in our Group\\u2019s revenue during this period, we have decided to remain focused on our core product offerings (i.e. bundling our technology financing solutions with other ICT products or offerings) and have yet to launch our business model of purchasing ICT Solutions through factoring financing. Nevertheless, we may revisit this plan again in the future should the need arise.\\n- Section: (iii); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: We intend to grow sales on our e-commerce platform On 16 February 2020, we launched our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, and have generated sales of approximately RM0.4 million up to 26 October 2020. Subsequent to the launch, we have optimised our back-end operational activities in terms of payment gateway solutions and logistics to improve customer experience. We acknowledge e-commerce as an effective means to reach out to the mass market and we believe that we can leverage the potential of the e-commerce industry to expand our business. According to the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the e-commerce market in Malaysia has illustrated healthy growth. The e-commerce market size in Malaysia, as depicted by e-commerce transaction values in the country, increased from RM195.1 billion in 2015 to RM268.6 billion in 2019 at a CAGR of 8.3%. The e-commerce market is expected to continue to grow in light of growing broadband penetration, proliferation of mobile devices, increased acceptance of digital payments, change in consumer lifestyle trends, rising income levels over the long-term, improved logistics infrastructure and favourable government initiatives. As such, we intend to grow sales from our e-commerce platform by intensifying our marketing efforts to promote our e-commerce platform. To this end, we will be investing in online advertising activities to increase traffic to our e commerce platform. We also intend to expand our sales team to include 2 new personnel by the end of 2020, who will be responsible for growing sales from this e-commerce platform. The estimated cost for these online advertising activities over the span of 1 year are approximately RM50,000, which will be funded via internally generated funds. Our e-commerce platform will allow us to capitalise on refurbished ICT hardware after expiry of the leasing and rental contracts. Further, our e-commerce platform will allow us to diversify our end-user customer base not just to include private corporations, government organisations and Channel Partners, but also retail consumers and third-party resellers.; Current Status or Progress: Since its launch, our Group\\u2019s e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, has contributed approximately RM3.28 million, RM2.45 million, RM2.99 million and RM1.04 million in revenue for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. The e-commerce platform enables us to capitalise on refurbished ICT hardware following the expiration of the leasing and rental contracts for the relevant ICT hardware. The e-commerce platform serves as a distribution channel to facilitate our Group\\u2019s disposal of refurbished ICT hardware (i.e. laptops, desktops, monitors, printers and projectors), thereby enhancing our Group\\u2019s financial performance. Additionally, it allows us to diversify our end-user customer base beyond private corporations, government organisations, and Channel Partners to include retail consumers and third-party resellers. Following the launch, we had in 2021 commenced and completed the optimisation of the back-end operational and marketing activities. Such optimisation includes enablement of online payment gateway solutions and logistics for door-to-door delivery, both of which serves to enhance the overall customer experience. In addition, we have also undertaken, amongst others, the following initiatives efforts to promote the e-commerce platform: (i) our Group has been collaborating with logistic service providers since 2021 to deliver ICT hardware purchased by the customers. As at the LPD, we have engaged 18 logistics service providers; (ii) launched a new range of removable vinyl sticker products with visually appealing designs in 2023 to enable customers to enhance the appearance of ICT hardware purchased; (iii) enhancing the functionality of the e-commerce platform by including a limited warranty on the product, which covers ICT hardware defects and ICT software malfunctions. In addition, we have also inserted a parcel/shipment tracking webpage on the e-commerce platform since 2021; and (iv) creating awareness on social media platforms (i.e. Facebook and Instagram) or social networking platforms (i.e. TikTok and LinkedIn) as well as investing in search engine optimisation for the Google Ad Word Search Engine to direct traffic to the e commerce platform since 2020. In addition, we also engage in promotional materials such as bunting and flyers as well as an Light Emitting Diode (LED) advertisement on a skybridge. From the FYE 2021 to FYE 2024, we had incurred marketing expenses of approximately RM54,000 for the promotion of the Group\\u2019s e-commerce platform. As such, the budgeted expenses for such marketing activities had been fully utilised. As at the LPD, the Group has recruited 5 personnel as the sales team dedicated to growing sales from the e-commerce platform. For the period commencing 1 February 2024 and up to the LPD, the e commerce platform has attracted a total of 12,329 visitors.\\n- Section: Section 4.1.4 Prospects (as disclosed by the Management of ICT Zone Asia); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: Our Group intends to leverage on our existing customer base to expand our revenue stream from device management software and computer security software. Further, our Group also intends to capture future growth opportunities by offering corporations and organisations factoring financing of ICT Solutions. This will allow potential customers to finance their assets, namely ICT hardware, to purchase newer ICT Solutions. We believe this to be an attractive proposition to corporations and organisations seeking to reduce initial upfront investments on ICT Solutions. In addition, our Group also intends to grow our e-commerce platform, namely www.komputermurah.my, which would target retail consumers and third-party resellers. In light of the growing e-commerce market in Malaysia, as highlighted in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, we acknowledge e-commerce as an effective means to reach out to retail consumers and third-party resellers, to expand our business. The recent COVID-19 pandemic had led to the implementation of national lockdown policies in many countries, including Malaysia. In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (\\u201cMCO\\u201d), which was implemented in March, entailed the closure of all Government and private premises except those involved in essential services (water, electricity, energy, telecommunications, postal, transportation, irrigation, oil, gas, fuel, lubricants, broadcasting, finance, banking, health, pharmacy, fire, prison, port, airport, safety, defence, cleaning, retail and food supply). The subsequent transition to Conditional MCO in May and Recovery MCO in June provided some relief to corporations as they were allowed to operate, though at a limited capacity. Although Conditional MCO and Enhanced MCO are implemented in October in several states and territories including Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya, Penang and Sabah due to a resurgence in number of new COVID-19 cases, the corporations are still allowed to operate at a limited capacity and are subject to travel restrictions in the relevant areas. As mentioned in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the COVID-19 pandemic played a part in driving the Digital Economy. Many corporations have implemented work-from-home policies during the MCO, Conditional MCO, Recovery MCO and Enhanced MCO periods, which gave rise to the use of digital tools to enable file sharing, virtual video and audio teleconferencing as well as project management tools. Our Group benefitted from the accelerated shift towards the Digital Economy and is expected to continue benefiting as ICT Solutions become increasingly essential in carrying out daily operational tasks. Thus, in the short-term, we do not foresee any material adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance, liquidity position and business operations. Against this backdrop, we seek a listing on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities to facilitate our future growth and strengthen our position as an ICT Solutions provider in Malaysia.; Current Status or Progress: The Government has identified the ICT sector as a key driver of economic growth. The Government has taken steps to encourage the development of the ICT sector through initiatives such as the National Digital Network (Jendela) and the Digital Economy Blueprint. As developing countries struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, digital solutions enable economic transformation and put them on a path toward green, resilient, and inclusive growth. The Government has introduced Malaysia Digital as the new national strategic initiative to encourage and attract companies, talents and investment while enabling businesses and the population in Malaysia to play a leading part in the global digital revolution and digital economy. To achieve this, the Government on 19 February 2021 launched the Malaysian Digital Economy blueprint, where an investment of RM15.0 billion was allocated to aid the implementation of 5G nationwide over a period of 10 years and the Malaysia Digital Economy is expected to contribute 22.6% of Malaysia\\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and create about 500,000 new jobs by the year 2025. With the new digitalisation targets rolled out, it is expected that the demand for ICT Solutions will increase in the near future following the Government\\u2019s efforts to achieve all the above targets. We are fully committed to playing our part in advancing the country\\u2019s digitalisation journey. For information purposes, our Group\\u2019s technology financing solutions businesses\\u2019 total unbilled order book for the next five years has increased to RM236.57 million as at the LPD from RM45.9 million as at 26 October 2020, being the latest practicable date before the date of the Information Memorandum issued on 6 November 2020. The substantial growth over the years highlights the increasing demand for the services and the confidence that our Group\\u2019s clients have in our ability to deliver customer-centric and sustainable solutions. The unbilled order books of RM236.57 million are expected to be progressively translated to revenue and profit over the next five financial years. In addition, our Group\\u2019s e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, has contributed approximately RM3.28 million, RM2.45 million, RM2.99 million and RM1.04 million in revenue for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. We will continue with our Group\\u2019s strategic focus on our business model of providing technology financing solutions and creating an ecosystem around these solutions to add value to our Group\\u2019s technology financing solutions. Thus, the leasing and rental of ICT Solutions will remain our Group\\u2019s primary focus for the coming year. On top of that, we will continue to enhance our operating model and cost structure to explore new financing options (including factoring financing) for ICT Solutions for our new and existing customers, should the need arise.\\n\\n[THE REST OF THIS PAGE HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] (p. 51)\",\n",

As such, this IMR report focuses on The ICT Solution Industry, which denotes the performance of the industry in which ICT Zone Asia Group\\u2019s operates. As ICT Zone Asia Group primarily serves the Malaysia market, wherein 98.87% to 99.97% of its revenue was generated from Malaysia, this IMR report will focus on the ICT Solution Industry in Malaysia.\\n\\n## 1 THE ICT SOLUTION INDUSTRY IN MALAYSIA\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nICT solutions refer to a collection of ICT hardware, ICT software, ICT services, as well as cloud solutions and services. ICT solutions have become increasingly important as a growing number of corporations and Government agencies digitalise and automate their operations. These ICT solutions are essential for corporations and Government agencies to run their day-to-day business operations, as well as perform transactions with customers and suppliers.\\n\\nICT hardware (such as desktops, laptops, printers and projectors) and ICT software (such as application software and operating systems) can be either:\\n\\n- Sold on an outright basis, where ICT hardware and/or ICT software are distributed or retailed to corporations, Government agencies and individual customers; or\\n\\n- Rented or leased, where ICT hardware and/or ICT software are rented or leased to corporations or Government agencies who will pay a monthly or annual fee for the continuous use of the ICT hardware and/or software.\\n\\nICT services are services provided to support corporations and Government agencies in the management and maintenance of the ICT hardware and ICT software (such as technical support, device management, maintenance, consultancy and managed services). These ICT services can either be provided alongside the rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software, or provided as a standalone service.\\n\\nMeanwhile, cloud solutions refer to computing resources that are delivered through the Internet (such as storage, network and applications) and provided on a subscription or on-demand basis. There are 3 main types of cloud solutions and services, namely:\\n\\n- infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), where ICT infrastructure (such as storage and network infrastructure) are provided on a pay-as-you-use basis. This allows for data storage, data backup and disaster recovery;\\n\\n- platform-as-a-service (PaaS), where applications can be built, deployed and managed without the complexity of managing the underlying (or physical) ICT infrastructure; and\\n\\n- software-as-a-service (SaaS), where software are provided on a pay-as-you-use basis.\\n\\nCloud services refer to the services involved in the implementation of these cloud solutions. These services include consultancy and management to propose suitable cloud solutions, cloud migration services to assist corporations and Government agencies to migrate their software applications and data from on-premises ICT infrastructure to cloud-based infrastructure, as well as implementation of cloud solutions.\\n\\nCloud solutions and services can be implemented based on the following deployment models:\\n\\n- private cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organisation, and will typically be managed internally and located on-premises;\\n\\n- public cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is shared by multiple organisations via the internet, which is typically offered by third-party providers; and\\n\\n- hybrid cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is a computing environment that combines both private cloud with public cloud.\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 204)\\n\\n### Value chain of the ICT solution industry\\n\\nThe ICT solution industry value chain typically comprises companies that are involved in:\\n\\n- Design and development of ICT hardware and ICT software \\u2013 companies which design and develop the ICT hardware and ICT software. These companies are typically established multinational companies, and are referred to as \\u201cPrincipals\\u201d. They may either sell their ICT hardware and ICT software to their appointed distributors, ICT solution provider or to end customers;\\n\\n- Distribution of ICT hardware and ICT software \\u2013 companies which market and sell ICT hardware and ICT software on behalf of the Principals, and are referred to as \\u201cAppointed distributors\\u201d. Appointed distributors typically sell to ICT solution providers or to end-customers; and\\n\\n- Provision of ICT solutions \\u2013 companies which provide the following ICT solutions:\\n    - Technology financing solutions \\u2013 companies which provide access to ICT solutions on a rental or lease basis;\\n    - Trading of ICT hardware and ICT software \\u2013 companies which sell ICT solutions on an outright basis;\\n    - Provision of ICT services \\u2013 companies which provide ICT services such as managed services;\\n    - Provision of cloud solutions and services \\u2013 companies which provide consultation to proposed suitable cloud solutions, cloud migration services and implementation of cloud solutions; and/or\\n    - Provision of other ICT solutions, and related services \\u2013 companies which provide consultation to propose a suitable ICT solution, implement and integrate various physical ICT hardware components and ICT software to form a complete ICT solution.\\n\\nICT solution providers may either provide their ICT solutions directly to end-customers or through channel partners.\\n\\n- Channel partners \\u2013 companies which are involved in securing orders or contracts from endcustomers (who are typically corporations and Government agencies) for ICT solution providers.\\n\\nFigure: ICT solution industry value chain (p. 204)\\n\\nThis figure is a flowchart depicting the ICT solution industry value chain. It begins with 'Design and development', which leads to 'Distribution'. This is handled by a 'Principal' who supplies an 'Appointed distributor'. The flow continues to 'Sales and implementation', where the appointed distributor provides products to various providers: 'Technology financing solution provider', 'ICT hardware and ICT software trader or retailer', 'ICT service provider', 'Cloud solution and service provider', and 'Other ICT solution provider'. These providers can then go directly to 'End-customers' or work through a 'Channel partner'. The final stage is 'End-customers', which includes 'Corporations, Government agencies, and individual customers'.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n(i) Denotes the segment in which ICT Zone Asia Group presently operates.\\n\\n(ii) This list is not exhaustive.\\n\\nSource: PROVIDENCE\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 205)\\n\\n### INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE, SIZE AND GROWTH\\n\\nThe performance of the ICT solution industry in Malaysia can be measured based on sales of the following:\\n\\n- **ICT hardware and ICT software**\\nThe ICT hardware and ICT software industry size Malaysia grew, in terms of industry revenue, from RM26.4 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM37.4 billion in 2024, registering a compound annual growth rate (\\u201cCAGR\\u201d) of 5.1% during the period. The ICT hardware and ICT software industry in Malaysia is forecast to grow by a CAGR of 4.8% between 2025 and 2027, to reach RM43.0 billion in 2027.\\n\\n- **ICT services**\\nThe ICT services industry size registered a CAGR of 6.3% during the same period, having grown from RM72.1 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM110.9 billion in 2024. ICT services industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2025 and 2027, to reach RM130.9 billion in 2027.\\n\\n- **Cloud solutions and services**\\nThe cloud solutions and services industry in Malaysia, as indicated by the expenditure on public, private and hybrid cloud infrastructure, grew from RM2.8 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM10.8 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 21.3%. Moving forward, the cloud solutions and services industry in Malaysia is forecast to grow by 20.3% between 2025 and 2027, to reach RM18.8 billion in 2027.\\n\\nFigure: ICT hardware and ICT software industry (p. 205)\\n\\nThis is a bar chart showing the ICT hardware and ICT software industry revenue in RM billion from 2017 to 2024 (estimated). The revenue grew from RM26.4 billion in 2017 to RM37.4 billion in 2024(e), with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.1% for the period.\\n\\nFigure: ICT services industry (p. 205)\\n\\nThis is a bar chart showing the ICT services industry revenue in RM billion from 2017 to 2024 (estimated). The revenue grew from RM72.1 billion in 2017 to RM110.9 billion in 2024(e), with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.3% for the period.\\n\\nFigure: Cloud solutions and services industry (p. 205)\\n\\nThis is a bar chart showing the Cloud solutions and services sales value in RM billion from 2017 to 2024 (estimated). The sales value grew from RM2.8 billion in 2017 to RM10.8 billion in 2024(e), with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.3% for the period.\\n\\nNote:\\ne - Estimate\\n\\nSource: Department of Statistics Malaysia, DataCube Research, PROVIDENCE analysis\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 206)\\n\\n### KEY DEMAND DRIVERS\\n\\nThe rapid pace of technological evolution and introduction of new trends, which would create a need for corporations and Government agencies to upgrade their ICT solutions\\n\\nThe evolution of technology has led to continuous introductions and advancements in ICT hardware and ICT software. Such ICT hardware and ICT software are constantly being enhanced in terms of speed, features and memory space, amongst others. This has led to corporations and Government agencies constantly upgrading their ICT hardware and ICT software to keep up with the latest trends in order to improve work productivity and efficiency.\\n\\nIn particular, some of the recent trends in the ICT solution industry include:\\n\\n- **The introduction of neural processing unit (\\u201cNPUs\\u201d)**\\nCentral processing units (\\u201cCPUs\\u201d) are currently commonly used as microprocessors, wherein CPUs act as the brains of computing devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets. CPUs are crucial in enabling computing devices to run operating systems and various applications. Over the years, more advanced versions of CPUs have constantly been introduced to allow for faster processing, increased efficiency as well as reduced power consumption.\\n\\nNPUs are specialised ICT hardware components designed to handle artificial intelligence (\\u201cAI\\u201d)-related tasks efficiently. In recent times, NPUs have begun to be used as main processors in personal computers in replacement of CPUs. This will revolutionise personal computers as NPUs can accelerate operating systems to perform AI-related tasks while consuming less energy, thereby contributing to longer battery life, faster execution and enhanced user experience.\\n\\nIn particular, Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s latest operating system, Windows 11, is built with Copilot. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency.\\n\\nAs Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s operating systems are the most commonly used operating system in personal computers today, and the shift towards Windows 11 will eventually encourage the adoption of NPUs in personal computers. This shift would consequently result in corporations and government agencies upgrading their ICT hardware and software, which would create demand for ICT solutions.\\n\\n- **Growing demand for rental and lease-based ICT solutions**\\nAs technology advances rapidly, the cost to keep up with the rapid changes may not be cost effective. Thus, in recent years, there is a shift in trend towards rental or lease-based ICT solutions, instead of ownership-based ICT solutions. This can be seen from the growth in leasing and rental of ICT hardware. Globally, the ICT hardware leasing and rental market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.0% from approximately USD120.0 billion in 2023 to approximately USD170.0 billion in 2030.\\u00b9 The growth in rental and leasing of ICT hardware is due to the lower upfront cost that allows corporations and Government agencies to reduce high capital investments. With the lower upfront capital investments, corporations and Government agencies are able to divert their capital investments to other income-generating activities. In particular, the Government of Malaysia has also adopted leasing models for ICT solutions over the years through its e-procurement system.\\u00b2\\n\\n- **Increased awareness and implementation of sustainable practices**\\nAnother trend is the increased awareness and implementation of sustainable practices in the ICT solution industry. The ICT hardware\\u2019s carbon footprint measures the greenhouse gas emissions throughout all phases of a product lifecycle, such as manufacturing, transportation, use and end of life processing. Examples of strategies to reduce carbon footprint include sourcing sustainable raw materials, designing computing devices with high energy efficiency, extending the lifespan of computing devices and responsible electronic waste management and purchasing carbon credits. Thus, \\u201cGreen\\u201d ICT solutions are thus sought after as they enable corporations and Government agencies to achieve sustainability goals.\\n\\n\\u00b9 Source: Verified Market Reports\\n\\u00b2 Source: PROVIDENCE analysis, myprocurement.strategy.gov.my\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 207)\\n\\n**Government initiatives to encourage digitalisation, which would drive demand for ICT solutions**\\n\\nThe digitalisation of the economy is known as the \\u201cDigital Economy\\u201d, which refers to the increasing adoption and utilisation of ICT solutions in carrying out day-to-day operational tasks in businesses across various economic sectors in order to improve efficiency and facilitate globalisation. The pervasive impact of the Digital Economy can be observed throughout various economic sectors including the banking sector (where cash-based transactions have shifted to online-based transactions), manufacturing sector (where manual operations can now be automated or remotely controlled) and retail sector (where stores are not limited to physical outlets but also e-commerce platforms). The Digital Economy is expected to expand in Malaysia and as such, ICT solutions will become increasingly essential in carrying out daily operational tasks. In Malaysia, the contribution of the Digital Economy to the country\\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown from 18.3% in 2017 to an estimated of 23.5% in 2023.\\u00b3\\n\\nThe National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan 2019-2023 will provide a favourable environment for the digitalisation of corporations and Government agencies, as it aimed to provide higher quality broadband at lower prices and improve connectivity throughout the country. This will have a positive impact on digitalisation, as high-quality digital connectivity is crucial to create and share digital data.\\n\\nIn February 2021, the Government of Malaysia launched Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (\\u201cMyDIGITAL\\u201d), a national initiative which aims to transform Malaysia into a digitally-driven, high-income nation and a regional leader in digital economy. MyDIGITAL maps out the strategies which will be undertaken in 3 phases (2021-2022, 2023-2025 and 2026-2030) to achieve the targeted outcomes of MyDIGITAL. Among the key thrusts in MyDIGITAL pertaining to the ICT solution industry are:\\n\\n(i) Drive digital transformation in the public sector \\u2013 leveraging digital technologies, data and digital intelligence to accelerate transformation into a digital government, both for public administration as well as to improve public service delivery; and\\n\\n(ii) Build enabling digital infrastructure \\u2013 providing access to extensive and high-quality digital infrastructure (such as broadband, data centres and cable landing stations) to better enable people, corporations and the Government of Malaysia to participate in the digital economy.\\n\\nTo this end, the Government of Malaysia announced MyGovCloud in May 2022, an upgrade of the Public Sector Data Centre into a hybrid cloud solution for use by all government agencies.\\n\\nFurther, in February 2021, the Government of Malaysia announced conditional approvals to 4 cloud service providers, namely Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Telekom Malaysia, to build and manage hyperscale data centres and cloud services, thus improving digital infrastructure in the country. These cloud service providers are expected to invest between RM12.0 and RM15.0 billion over the next 5 years.\\n\\nUnder Budget 2024, the Government of Malaysia announced enhanced efforts to encourage micro, small, and medium enterprises (\\u201cMSMEs\\u201d) to boost business resiliency and competitiveness in adopting automation and digitalisation solutions. The allocations provided include RM100.0 million for digitalisation grants of up to RM5,000 for upgrading of sales, inventory and digital accounting systems, as well as RM900.0 million to encourage small and medium enterprises (\\u201cSMEs\\u201d) to increase productivity levels through automation and digitalisation.\\n\\nUnder Budget 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia is providing an RM3.8 billion SME loan fund to support entrepreneurs make the shift to digitalisation and automation. Further, RM50.0 million has been allocated towards the Digital Matching Grant for SMEs and Digital Grant for Vendors under Bank Simpanan Nasional to accelerate digital transformation.\\n\\nThese government initiatives to drive the digital economy in Malaysia will lead to demand for ICT solutions, thus benefiting ICT solution providers.\\n\\n**The move towards digitalisation of corporations and Government agencies, leading to an increased need for ICT solutions**\\n\\nDigitalisation has played a major role in allowing corporations and Government agencies to continue operations while staying relevant in the current business environment.\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures were imposed globally to prevent the spread of the disease. This forced corporations and Government agencies to adapt to the situation with work from home arrangements for their employees. In order to ensure continued business productivity, corporations and Government agencies had to make use of technologies which could facilitate online collaboration, such as file sharing, messaging platforms, video conferencing and project management tools. The use of such\\n\\n\\u00b3 Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia. Latest publicly available data is as at 2023.\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 208)\\n\\ntechnologies creates digital data, which require supporting ICT solutions such as servers and data storage space.\\n\\nGlobalisation has created more opportunities for corporations and Government agencies as they are no longer restricted to operating within their own country. Everything from sourcing raw materials, production, marketing, distribution and support services can be sourced from other countries. Digitalisation has allowed corporations and Government agencies to lower their costs and gain larger market share as they are able to explore new opportunities in other countries.\\n\\nCorporations and Government agencies need to take advantage of digitalisation to maintain competitiveness and explore new opportunities in today\\u2019s evolving business environment. As more corporations and Government agencies make the move towards digitalisation, they will require supporting ICT solutions.\\n\\n**Growing number of companies, which indicates an increase in demand for ICT solutions**\\n\\nMalaysia has seen a steady growth of newly registered companies at an average increase of 3.5% annually between 2017 and 2024. According to latest available data from the Companies Commission of Malaysia, total companies in Malaysia grew from 1.3 million in 2017 to 1.6 million in 2024. In 2022, 54,529 companies were dissolved in Malaysia, which translated to 3.8% of the number of registered companies in the year.\\u2074 This indicates that there is a low percentage of companies that are dissolved of companies that are registered in Malaysia.\\n\\nThe steady growth trend of companies in Malaysia is expected to continue in light of the nation\\u2019s developing economy over the long-term. The growing number of companies registered each year provides opportunities for greater demand for ICT solutions in Malaysia, either through subscriptions or purchases of new ICT solutions or upgrade their current ICT solutions.\\n\\n**Benefits of reducing upfront investments for ICT solutions for corporations and Government agencies**\\n\\nThe rental or lease of ICT solutions allows customers and end-user customers to shift from capital to operational expenditure, thereby helping their corporations or Government agencies to be more competitive through substantially lower capital investments. ICT solution rental and lease eliminate the need for heavy upfront capital investments as corporations and Government agencies are able to obtain new ICT solutions and add computing capabilities without incurring risky large capital expenditures but instead pay smaller monthly or annual fee. Thus, the increased affordability is consequently expected to drive demand for ICT solutions. With the lower upfront expenditure, corporations and Government agencies are able to divert the capital to other income-generating activities.\\n\\nIn recent years, the rental and leasing business model is gaining popularity, especially amongst MSMEs and Government agencies, as this business model frees up their capital for other income-generating business activities. Furthermore, corporations and Government agencies may also benefit from the convenience of procuring other added services offered by the same ICT solution provider, typically at an extra cost, such as consultancy, comprehensive customer and/or technical support, up-to-date devices/components, insurance, maintenance and repair services. In addition, the rental and leasing services are also suitable for corporations and Government agencies that are taking part in temporary or short-term events such as exhibitions which only require the temporary use of ICT infrastructure for a short duration.\\n\\n**Rising income levels which will lead to greater spending power for ICT hardware and ICT software amongst individual customers**\\n\\nMalaysia\\u2019s gross national income (GNI) per capita grew from RM41,647 in 2017 to RM54,894 in 2024. The increase in disposable income will lead to greater spending power, creating demand for ICT hardware and ICT software amongst individual customers. The disposable income of the population in Malaysia is expected to continue growing in the long-term, and this will support demand for ICT hardware and ICT software.\\n\\n\\u2074 Source: Companies Commission of Malaysia Annual Report 2022. Latest publicly available information is as at 2022\\n\\n## 8 INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd) (p. 209-210)\\n\\n### COMPETITIVE OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe ICT solution industry is fragmented as it consists of a large number of companies that are involved in various types of ICT solutions.\\n\\nAs a majority of ICT Zone Asia Group\\u2019s revenue is derived from technology financing solutions and trading of ICT hardware and ICT software (90.16% to 93.57% of ICT Zone Asia Group\\u2019s revenue between the financial year ending (\\u201cFYE\\u201d) 31 January 2022 and FYE 31 January 2024), this IMR report will focus on industry players that offer leasing, rental and/or sale of ICT hardware and/or ICT software. Companies involved in the sale of ICT hardware and/or ICT software may sell their ICT hardware and/or ICT software to corporations, Government agencies or individual customers. Companies that sell to corporations and Government agencies generally sell ICT hardware and/or ICT software in bulk. Meanwhile, companies that sell to individual customers typically sell ICT hardware and/or ICT software through physical retail stores or online marketplaces or platforms. Some companies are involved in the sale of ICT hardware and/or ICT software to corporations and Government agencies as well as individual customers.\\n\\nPROVIDENCE has identified the following industry players on the basis that:\\n\\n(i) They are offering leasing and/or rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software in Malaysia and they are involved in the sale of ICT hardware and/or ICT software in Malaysia to corporations and/or Government agencies.

However, in order to provide leasing and/or rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software, companies must have the financial resources or capability to secure financing to procure ICT hardware. Thus, the barriers to entry of companies involved in the leasing and/or rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software is moderately high. Nevertheless, to remain competitive in the market, industry players have to scale up their business and secure consistent supply of products as well as establish relationships with their suppliers.\\n\\n### MARKET SHARE\\n\\nBased on the total ICT solution industry size of RM149.7 billion and ICT Zone Asia Group\\u2019s revenue of RM114.4 million in the FYE 31 January 2024, ICT Zone Group garnered an industry revenue share of 0.07% in 2023.\\n\\n## 2 PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK FOR ICT ZONE ASIA GROUP\\n\\nMoving forward, the ICT hardware and software, ICT services, and cloud solutions and services industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at CAGRs of 4.8%, 5.7% and 20.3% between 2025 and 2027. As an ICT solution industry player, ICT Zone Asia Group stands to benefit from this growth which is driven by:\\n\\n- The rapid pace of technological evolution and introduction of new trends, which would create a need for corporations and Government agencies to upgrade their ICT solutions;\\n\\n- Government initiatives to encourage digitalisation, which would drive demand for ICT solutions;\\n\\n- The move towards digitalisation of corporations and Government agencies, leading to an increased need for ICT solutions;\\n\\n- Growing number of companies, which indicates an increase in demand for ICT solutions;\\n\\n- Benefits of reducing upfront investments for ICT solutions for corporations and Government agencies; and\\n\\n- Rising income levels which will lead to greater spending power for ICT hardware and software amongst individual customers.\",\n",

      "    \"ICT_ZONE_ASIA_BERHAD_IPO_SECTION_7\": \"# 7 BUSINESS OVERVIEW\\n\\n## 7.1 Overview (p. 110)\\n\\n### 7.1.1 Overview of Our Business (p. 110)\\n\\nOur Company was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 28 January 2019 as a private limited company under the name ICT Zone Asia Sdn Bhd. Subsequently, our Company was converted to a public limited company and assumed the name of ICT Zone Asia Berhad on 21 May 2019. ICT Zone Asia has been listed on the LEAP Market for more than 3 years, i.e. since 15 December 2020. (p. 110)\\n\\nOur Group is an ICT Solutions provider, where we are principally involved in the provision of technology financing solutions, ICT hardware and software trading, ICT services, and cloud solutions and services. Our customer base comprises Channel Partners, Strategic Partners, private and public corporations, Government-linked corporations and agencies as well as retail customers. (p. 110)\\n\\nICT Solutions generally refer to ICT hardware, ICT software, cloud subscriptions as well as ICT services. In today\\u2019s technology-enabled world, most, if not all, corporations and Government agencies use ICT Solutions to carry out daily operational tasks or automate and digitise their operations. Thus, various ICT hardware such as desktops, laptops, printers and projectors, ICT software such as operating systems and application software, and cloud subscriptions which are applications offered on a subscription basis, are essential in business operations. ICT services such as consultancy, maintenance, technical support and device management are also important in supporting the use of ICT hardware, software and cloud subscriptions. (p. 110)\\n\\n### 7.1.2 Description of Our Business Model (p. 110)\\n\\nTypically, our business value chain and relationship between our Principals and Principals\\u2019 Distributors as well as Channel Partners and Strategic Partners and end-users are as depicted below: (p. 110)\\n\\nFigure: Business Value Chain (p. 110)\\nThe diagram illustrates the flow of ICT solutions. It starts with a Principal, who provides products to a Principal's Distributor and an Appointed Distributor. These distributors then supply ICT hardware, software, and cloud solutions to the ICT Zone Asia Group. The ICT Zone Asia Group, in turn, provides technology financing solutions, trading of ICT hardware and software, ICT services, and cloud solutions and services to its Channel and Strategic Partners, who then deliver these solutions to the End-users.\\n\\nWe have been appointed by Principals as Appointed Resellers, thus allowing us to lease, rent, sell or use their ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions. We typically procure ICT hardware and software from Principal(s) and Principals\\u2019 Distributors. The Principal(s) will set the pricing for their Distributor(s) to sell the ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions to appointed resellers such as our Group either on an outright basis or subscription basis. We can only purchase the ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions from the Principal or Principal\\u2019s Distributor(s). Despite procuring products from the Principal\\u2019s Distributor(s), we may engage with the Principal(s) to negotiate better pricing arrangements, particularly for orders or contracts that are larger in sales volume or value. Once the pricing has been agreed upon, the Principals will then inform their Distributor(s) to sell the said ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscription at the pre-agreed pricing to us. (p. 110)\\n\\nAs and when required, we may also rent ICT hardware from third-party service providers. This occurs when we have higher demand for short-term rentals of ICT hardware, and/or a limited number of ICT hardware available, and/or have requests for specific refurbished ICT hardware brands or types that we do not keep as inventory. (p. 111)\\n\\nOur Group may also lease ICT hardware from leasing companies, and these ICT hardware are subsequently subleased to our customers. These leases are operating leases as our Group does not assume the ownership or substantial risks associated with ownership of these assets. (p. 111)\\n\\nWe lease, rent or sell ICT Solutions to Channel Partners and end-users. We may also sign strategic partnership agreements with some Channel Partners (whom we named as \\u201cStrategic Partners\\u201d) for us to have the exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Please refer to Section 7.13 of this Prospectus for further information on our sales channels. (p. 111)\\n\\nWe also sell refurbished ICT hardware directly, through Channel Partners and Strategic Partners and via our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, to retail customers. (p. 111)\\n\\nApart from the above, we also use ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscription sourced from Principals and/or Principals\\u2019 Distributors in the provision of cloud solutions and services to Channel Partners and end-users. (p. 111)\\n\\n## 7.2 History and Key Milestones (p. 111)\\n\\n### 7.2.1 History (p. 111)\\n\\nThe history of the ICT Zone Asia Group can be traced back to 2000, when our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang, and Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, DS Ng, incorporated ICT Zone Holding (then known as NTP World Marketing Sdn Bhd). At that time, ICT Zone Holding was involved in the trading of audio-visual equipment to private corporations. (p. 111)\\n\\nICT Zone was subsequently incorporated in 2001 by our Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, DS Ng and another shareholder, Hoo Geok Choong (who had ceased to be a shareholder of ICT Zone since 2015). ICT Zone remained dormant until 2003, when our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang, and ICT Zone Holding became shareholders. ICT Zone commenced its business in the trading and short-term rental of ICT hardware and software to private and public corporations and retail customers in 2003. (p. 111)\\n\\nIn 2004, we began to secure sales from our Channel Partners for their onward sale or rental to end-users in the Government sector. We secured our first order from Starza, who was then a Channel Partner to the end-users in the Government sector in 2004. Since then, we began to focus on expanding our customer base of private and public corporations and Channel Partners, and ceased selling to retail customers. As volume from our trading of ICT hardware and software segment grew, we were recognised as an Appointed Reseller by one of our Principals from whom we obtain our supplies of ICT hardware, Hewlett-Packard (M) Sdn Bhd (whose business is presently under HP Inc.) in 2009. (p. 111)\\n\\nPursuant to ICT Zone becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ICT Zone Holding in 2006, ICT Zone Holding ceased its business of trading of audio-visual equipment which was then transferred to ICT Zone. Thereafter, ICT Zone Holding became an investment holding company. (p. 111)\\n\\nRealising the opportunities in renting ICT Solutions, our Group began to venture into long-term rental of ICT Solutions when we introduced EzRental in 2010. In the same year, ICT Zone Ventures was incorporated with the intention to establish, manage and operate the Shariah-compliant interest scheme under Section 28 of the Interest Schemes Act 2016 and Interest Schemes Regulations 2017. Interest scheme involves the pooling of financial contribution from the public in exchange for an interest in a particular scheme. Such interest includes the usage of the facilities and services provided under the scheme or profit or returns, depending on the nature of the scheme. Such scheme is registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia. (p. 112)\\n\\nICT Zone Ventures had launched its first interest scheme on 28 March 2011 (which was subsequently converted from a conventional interest scheme to Shariah-compliant scheme after a year from its launch) and second Shariah-compliant interest scheme on 21 October 2014. Such interest schemes provided our Group with the capital to finance and support our offering of long-term rental of ICT Solutions. (p. 112)\\n\\nIn 2010, we began to sign strategic partnership agreements with our Strategic Partners. This provides us with the exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to end-users of our Strategic Partners within the Government sector. Starza and Juricco (then known as Belia Wawasan Holding Sdn Bhd) became our Strategic Partners in 2010, and Haynik (then known as Haynik Mobile Venture Sdn Bhd) became our Strategic Partner in 2011. (p. 112)\\n\\nIn 2013, we began to offer leasing of ICT hardware and software under the brand name, i-leasing, after we were registered with Bank Negara Malaysia to offer leasing and factoring services under Section 21(1) of the Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989. For information, pursuant to the repeal of the Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989 by the Financial Services Act 2013 in the same year, such registration is no longer required. (p. 112)\\n\\nAs the volume of ICT hardware and software that we rented, leased and traded increased, we were appointed as Appointed Resellers by other Principals, including Microsoft Corporation in 2012, Dell Technologies Inc. in 2014 and Lenovo Group Limited in 2015. (p. 112)\\n\\nIn 2019, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with vPROT MSP Sdn Bhd, thus rendering them a Strategic Partner. (p. 112)\\n\\nICT Zone Asia was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 28 January 2019 as a public company under its present name as a special purpose vehicle to facilitate our listing on the LEAP Market. It commenced its business on 9 December 2019 upon completion of the acquisition of ICT Zone, ICT Zone Ventures and Techfin Capital. (p. 112)\\n\\nOur funds raised from the interest schemes also grew, providing us with capital to secure more rental and leasing orders and contracts over the years. Up to August 2020, ICT Zone Ventures had raised a total of RM37.4 million from both schemes. The interest schemes were redeemed, whereby RM18.9 million was converted to ordinary shares and ICPS while the balance of RM18.5 million was repaid. The interest schemes were subsequently terminated to facilitate ICT Zone Asia\\u2019s listing on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities. Our Company had on 6 November 2020 submitted a listing application to Bursa Securities in relation to admission of our Company to the Official List of Bursa Securities and the listing and quotation of entire issued share capital comprising 533,757,500 ordinary shares and 75,320,000 ICPS on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities. For information, our Company officially listed on LEAP Market of Bursa Securities on 15 December 2020. (p. 112)\\n\\nSince our listing on the LEAP Market, we began to extend the range of value-added services offered with the leasing and renting of ICT Solutions, thus allowing us to rename our leasing and renting solutions to technology financing solutions. (p. 112)\\n\\nWe later launched DaaS 360, which is a full suite of value-added services (comprising proactive and analytical services for devices, managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services, data backup and device recovery services and security management) offered with our long-term ICT rental services in 2021. (p. 113)\\n\\nWe later expanded our range of value-added services and began offering \\u201cgreen\\u201d ICT Solutions when we introduced CNCS in July 2024. CNCS involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent to corporations and Government agencies. In this regard, we participate in the Bursa Carbon Exchange to purchase carbon credits. Once the carbon credits are used to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent, it is then registered and certified with Verra, a global independent non-profit organisation that develops and manages standards for sustainable development. (p. 113)\\n\\nOur Group also expanded our range of ICT Solutions to include cloud solutions and services upon completing the Acquisition of Haas and Share Subscription in Haas on 22 November 2021 and 25 November 2021 respectively, which resulted in Haas becoming a 58.25% subsidiary of our Group. HaaS is principally engaged in cloud solutions and cloud consultancy services under the CLOUDIFY.ASIA brand. ICT Zone Asia acquired 255,000 ordinary shares in HaaS for a total cash consideration of RM204,000 from ICT Zone Holding and entered into a share subscription agreement with HaaS for the subscription of 345,000 new ordinary shares for a total cash consideration of RM276,000. The transactions were not subject to the approval of the shareholders of ICT Zone Asia. (p. 113)\\n\\nIn the meantime, we also launched our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, thus expanding our customer base of retail customers in 2020. We were also appointed as Appointed Resellers by other Principals, including ASUStek Computer Inc. in 2022, Acer Inc. and Veeam Software Inc. in 2023, Fortinet, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2024. (p. 113)\\n\\nThroughout the years, we have obtained various awards and recognitions. ICT Zone Ventures attained the ISO 14001:2015 certification in April 2023, marking a significant milestone in its commitment to environmental sustainability. The ISO 14001:2015 certification denotes that our Group has a comprehensive framework to enhance our environmental management system and integrate sustainability into our business practices. This includes offering ICT Solutions that are designed to be durable, recyclable, and reusable. (p. 113)\\n\\nOur DaaS 360 has also been certified with the MyHIJAU mark, a green recognition scheme endorsed by the MGTC since June 2023. The MyHIJAU mark certifies that our DaaS 360 service meets the MGTC standards and is now certified as a green service. (p. 113)\\n\\nOn 3 November 2023, our company had completed the Private Placement following the issuance of 53,375,700 new Shares, which resulted in an enlarged 587,133,200 Shares. Please refer to Section 4.11 of this Prospectus for further details of the utilisation of proceeds pursuant to the Private Placement. (p. 113)\\n\\nOn 12 November 2024, 70,000 ICPS were converted to 70,000 Shares and the remaining 75,250,000 ICPS had matured on 21 January 2025 and converted to 75,250,000 Shares on 22 January 2025. (p. 113)\\n\\nICT Zone Ventures had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation Sdn Bhd (MDEC) on 25 March 2025 to collaborate on the Business Digitalisation Initiative. The Business Digitalisation Initiative is an initiative driven by the Government of Malaysia that aims to provide assistance to micro, small and medium enterprises to support the digitalisation of their businesses. This assistance includes providing access to financing (such as microfinancing and alternative funding options), advisory on adopting technologies, digital maturity assessments, and upskilling opportunities through workshops and online courses. Based on the memorandum of understanding, we will provide our ICT Solutions, including DaaS 360 and ICT services, and conduct technical training sessions for these solutions over a period of 2 years, or unless earlier terminated by either party. This will support the Business Digitalisation Initiative which aims to accelerate digital adoption by providing financial support, advisory and digital maturity assessment. (p. 113-114)\\n\\nAs at the LPD, we have also been granted Partner by Sangfor Technologies (Hong Kong) Limited; HP Amplify Power Partner by HP Inc.; Platinum and Gold Partner by Dell Technologies Inc.; Silver Solution Provider by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise; Cloud and Service Provider by Veeam Software Inc.; Business Partner by Acer Inc.; Authorised Reseller by Fortinet, Inc.; Appointed Reseller by Lenovo Group Limited; Commercial Partner by ASUStek Computer Inc.; and Solutions Partner by Microsoft Corporation. All of these recognitions are provided by the Principals based on amongst others, the sales volume of their ICT hardware and software sold to us and/or the number of personnel trained by the respective Principals.

The main customer segments are Channel Partners, Strategic Partners, Private and public corporations, Government-linked corporations and agencies, and Retail customers. The principal markets are primarily Malaysia, with some services extending to Singapore, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. The business is divided into four main activities: Technology financing solutions (leasing/rental of ICT hardware/software/services), Trading of ICT hardware and software (transaction-based revenue), Provision of ICT services (service fees for ICT and refurbishment), and Provision of cloud solutions and services (fees for cloud solutions, platform rental, trading, service, and training for PaaS, IaaS, and ICT services).\\n\\nFigure: Revenue Breakdown by Business Segment (FYE 2022 - FPE 2024) (p. 116)\\nThis figure contains four pie charts showing the revenue breakdown for FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024, and FPE 2024. For FYE 2022 (RM52.03 million total), Technology financing was 43.02%, Trading of ICT hardware/software was 47.14%, Provision of cloud solutions was 9.73%, and Provision of ICT services was 0.11%. For FYE 2023 (RM75.06 million total), the breakdown was 44.12%, 49.45%, 6.10%, and 0.33% respectively. For FYE 2024 (RM114.43 million total), it was 43.14%, 48.62%, 8.00%, and 0.24%. For FPE 2024 (RM95.56 million total), it was 65.02%, 26.17%, 8.50%, and 0.31%.\\n\\nFigure: Gross Profit Breakdown by Business Segment (FYE 2022 - FPE 2024) (p. 116)\\nThis figure contains four pie charts showing the gross profit breakdown for FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024, and FPE 2024. For FYE 2022 (RM11.05 million total), Technology financing was 66.11%, Trading of ICT hardware/software was 16.64%, Provision of cloud solutions was 16.88%, and Provision of ICT services was 0.37%. For FYE 2023 (RM15.01 million total), the breakdown was 70.01%, 12.45%, 17.12%, and 0.42% respectively. For FYE 2024 (RM19.75 million total), it was 70.64%, 15.79%, 13.19%, and 0.38%. For FPE 2024 (RM21.67 million total), it was 81.02%, 5.05%, 13.31%, and 0.61%.\\n\\nThe principal activity of ICT Zone Asia is the investment holding of subsidiaries involved in the following business segments: (p. 117)\\n\\n- (i) **Technology financing solutions** (p. 117)\\n  Technology financing solutions refer to a combination of technology solutions to provide ICT Solutions, and financing solutions to provide customers with access to these ICT Solutions over an agreed duration. These ICT Solutions include ICT hardware such as computers, laptops, printers, projectors and related peripheral devices, and ICT software such as operating systems, antivirus and other computer security software, and application software. Value-added ICT services to support the use of ICT hardware and software are typically offered alongside these technology financing solutions. (p. 117)\\n  \\n  Traditionally, ICT distributors/resellers\\u2019 primary function is to distribute ICT Solutions outright but their involvement usually ends at the point of sale, while financial service providers strictly specialise in providing financial solutions to facilitate the purchase of ICT Solutions. In contrast, technology financing solutions refer to a combination of ICT Solutions and financing solutions to provide customers with access to ICT Solutions on a lease or rental basis, thereby spreading customers\\u2019 cost over time, whilst giving customers the peace of mind as such ICT Solutions include maintenance services. Essentially, technology financing solutions: (p. 117)\\n  \\n  (a) provide alternative means for customers to use and manage their ICT hardware and software so that: (p. 117)\\n  \\n  - end-users need not incur capital expenditure to acquire and own the ICT hardware and software; (p. 117)\\n  \\n  - end-users need not seek monetary financing services and separately source and procure their ICT hardware and software. Effectively, this minimises the need for end-users to manage multiple orders or contracts with ICT Solutions providers and financing solution providers; (p. 117)\\n  \\n  - end-users need not negotiate pricing and other terms directly with the Principals. As we are Appointed Resellers of brands such as Acer, ASUS, Microsoft, HP, Dell and Lenovo, we can negotiate directly with the Principals to procure the necessary ICT hardware and software at better pricing and terms; (p. 117)\\n  \\n  - end-users, who may lack relevant competencies in the ICT domain, can avoid unnecessary spending on redundant ICT Solutions; (p. 117)\\n  \\n  - end-users can upgrade their ICT hardware which are near the end of its lifespan or which are not relevant to the latest technological trends, without having to incur capital expenditure to acquire new ICT hardware; (p. 117)\\n  \\n  (b) provide value-added ICT services to manage the ICT services so that end-users need not incur costs to employ a team of IT personnel to manage the ICT hardware. (p. 117)\\n  \\n  Thus, with technology financing, customers can liaise with a single vendor for the abovementioned services as opposed to navigating between multiple vendors. (p. 117)\\n\\nOur Group provides customers with various alternative means to use and manage their ICT Solutions, including: (p. 118)\\n\\nTable: [no title] (p. 118)\\n- Type of technology financing: Leasing; Rental\\n- Product branding: i-leasing; EzRental; DaaS 360\\n- Service offered: Leasing services; Short-term and long-term rental; Long-term rental\\n- Type of value-added ICT services offered: Nil; Managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services; Managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services, Proactive and analytical services for devices, Security management, Data backup and device recovery services, CNCS\\n- ICT hardware and software: New ICT hardware and software; New and refurbished ICT hardware, and ICT software\\n- Typical order/contract period: 3 to 5 years; Short-term (Less than 6 months), Long-term (6 months to 5 years); 3 to 5 years\\n\\n(a) **Leasing** (p. 118)\\n**i-leasing**\\nWe carry out the leasing of new ICT hardware and software under the i-leasing brand, on an operating lease basis.

(p. 123)\\n(2) Less than 0.01%. (p. 123)\\n\\n## 7.6 Significant Products/Services Introduced (p. 123)\\n\\nOther than our business activities as stated in Section 7.3 above, we have not introduced any other significant products/services as at the LPD. (p. 123)\\n\\n## 7.7 Competitive Strengths (p. 123)\\n\\nWe believe that the following competitive strengths underpin our successes and prospects: (p. 123)\\n\\n- (i) **We offer a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions** (p. 123)\\n  We offer a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions with various business models, including leasing, rental or on a solution basis as is done through cloud solutions and services. We also provide our customers with a diverse range of ICT hardware, software and cloud subscriptions sourced from various Principals and Principal\\u2019s Distributors. We believe this provides our customers with the following benefits: (p. 123)\\n\\n  (a) **We provide customers with the option to lease, rent or purchase of ICT Solutions on an outright basis** (p. 123)\\n  We do not only offer our customers the option of purchasing ICT Solutions on an outright sale basis. They may also rent or lease these ICT Solutions from us based on their budget and needs, which will lower their upfront capital investment. Medium to large corporations and Government agencies typically have more than 500 employees. As such, the capital investment for ICT Solutions for all of its employees can amount to a large sum. For illustrative purposes, a company would have to invest at least RM1.50 million on ICT Solutions for 500 employees, assuming a budget of RM3,000 per employee. (p. 123)\\n\\n  Further, corporations and Government agencies can upgrade their ICT hardware which are near the end of its lifespan or which are no longer relevant to the latest technological trends, without having to incur capital expenditure to acquire new ICT hardware. (p. 123)\\n\\n  Apart from the above, customers of our cloud solutions and services can also opt to lease or rent the ICT hardware and software required in their private or hybrid cloud infrastructure in order to lower their upfront capital investment. (p. 123)\\n\\n  (b) **We provide convenience to customers from dealing with a single solution provider** (p. 123)\\n  Customers need not seek separate solution providers to obtain monetary financing services and source and procure their ICT Solutions. Effectively, this minimises the need for customers to manage multiple orders and contracts with ICT Solutions providers and/or financing solution providers. (p. 123)\\n\\n  In addition, customers can procure a range of ICT Solutions from us, as opposed to sourcing from separate vendors. We offer our customers the benefit of convenience, particularly in handling orders, delivery, integration of these ICT Solutions. (p. 123)\\n\\n  In addition, as we can bundle value-added ICT services with our technology financing solutions, our customers need not obtain services from separate vendors to provide services such as maintenance, technical support services, proactive and analytical services, data backup and recovery, and security management. (p. 124)\\n\\n  (c) **We can source suitable ICT Solutions that meet customers\\u2019 needs and business size** (p. 124)\\n  We can consult our customers and provide ICT Solutions which are ideal for their needs and business size, while taking into account their budget. This not only includes sourcing or renting or leasing suitable types of brands and types of ICT hardware and ICT software either through Principals or third-party service providers and leasing companies for customers of our technology financing and trading segments but also for the setting up of cloud solutions and services for our customers. As such, customers lacking relevant competencies in the ICT domain can avoid unnecessary spending on redundant ICT Solutions. (p. 124)\\n\\n  (d) **We provide customers with access to expertise in sourcing and managing ICT Solutions** (p. 124)\\n  We also provide value-added ICT services so that end-users need not incur costs to employ a team of IT personnel to manage the ICT Solutions. Such ICT services reduce the burden on corporations and Government agencies to constantly procure new ICT Solutions, manage security, backup data, replace or upgrade ICT Solutions as well as perform maintenance and troubleshooting to ensure the ICT hardware remains functional. (p. 124)\\n\\n- (ii) **We have an established network of Principals and Principals\\u2019 Distributors** (p. 124)\\n  We work with multiple Principals and their Distributors, and thus we are not tied to a particular brand. Our ability to access a wide range of ICT hardware and software from numerous brands has allowed us to cater to a diverse range of requirements based on factors such as customers\\u2019 preference for brands, needs and budget. As such, we are able to meet our customers\\u2019 demands with the necessary ICT hardware and software depending on their requirements and preferences to brands. (p. 124)\\n\\n  We have been sourcing sizable volumes of ICT hardware and software from Principals who are highly reputable in the global ICT market. As a result, we have been recognised as an Appointed Reseller of brands such as Sangfor, Acer, Fortinet, ASUS, Microsoft, HP, Dell, Veeam and Lenovo. (p. 124)\\n\\n  These recognitions enable us to negotiate pricing and terms with these Principals directly. This could in turn lead to us being able to offer ICT Solutions at better pricing and terms. In addition, our close working relationship with these Principals provides us with insights into the latest ICT trends and thus, facilitates us in meeting market demand. (p. 124)\\n\\n- (iii) **Our management and operations team have the technical expertise and experience to provide ICT Solutions and secure financing to facilitate our technology financing solutions** (p. 124)\\n  We have been operating our business for over 20 years, and we are led by an experienced and committed Board and key senior management team. Our key senior management team has extensive experience across a broad spectrum of business activities, from operations to finance to sales and marketing. Their experience, drive and passion for our business have been instrumental to our Group\\u2019s vision and growth strategies. (p. 124)\\n\\n  Further, our key senior management team is supported by a strong operations team. As at the LPD, we have 22 personnel in the operations department, of which 13 are technical personnel responsible for carrying out the configuration or implementation and testing of our ICT Solutions as well as ICT services. (p. 125)\\n\\n  Our management and operations team\\u2019s technical know-how and experience in providing ICT Solutions have been accumulated since the commencement of our business in 2003. We have thus gained understanding on the ICT needs and requirements of our existing and prospective customers comprising private and public corporations as well as Government-linked corporations and agencies. This has allowed us to propose suitable leasing and rental packages for prospective customers, as can be seen through our ability to grow the number of orders and contracts secured for technology financing solutions in the past. (p. 125)\\n\\n  Our understanding of the ICT needs and requirements of our existing and prospective customers also enables us to propose suitable types of ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud solutions and services that meet their brand preferences, needs and budget. In addition, we can also anticipate any other ICT services required and can thus respond to our customers\\u2019 needs promptly. (p. 125)\\n\\n  Over the years, we have also built a network of stakeholders in the ICT industry, including Principals, Principals\\u2019 Distributors, Channel Partners and Strategic Partners. This allows us to negotiate pricing and terms with Principals and/or Principals\\u2019 Distributors, and work with our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to develop proposals for their potential customers (who in turn are end-users) as well as gain insights into the latest industry trends and challenges and prospective customers\\u2019 track records in the ICT industry. During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, we have served 137, 129, 311 and 411 orders and contracts for 67, 71, 245 and 350 end-customers through these Strategic Partners for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. (p. 125)\\n\\n  Apart from the above, we have also garnered experience in securing financing to facilitate our technology financing solution segment. Initially, we secured funding through interest schemes, where our first interest scheme was launched in 2011 through ICT Zone Ventures. We subsequently began to secure financing from financial institutions as our corporate profile was built through our listing on the LEAP Market. Our ability to secure financing from financial institutions allows us to raise more capital, to take on more orders and contracts for technology financing solutions. (p. 125)\\n\\n  Further, with our technical knowledge regarding financing, we are able to identify and assess potential risks that may arise from orders and contracts before entering them. While we are capable of undertaking orders and contracts of varying sizes, we have a credit and collection team to conduct creditworthiness assessments to ensure our customers are trustworthy and financially stable before entering into such orders and contracts. We undertake these stringent measures to manage potential risks from orders and contracts as well as assess the viability of the orders and contract. (p. 125)\\n\\n  We believe our management and operations team\\u2019s technical know-how and experience have enabled us to establish our Group\\u2019s track record and credentials in Malaysia. We believe our market reputation will support our Group\\u2019s future growth and expansion plans, thus ensuring our continued sustainability. (p. 125)\\n\\n- (iv) **We are well-positioned to capture the opportunities present in the technology financing industry** (p. 126)\\n  According to the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the ICT hardware and software industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.8%, while the ICT services industry size is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2025 and 2027. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  This growth is expected to be driven by new technological evolutions and industry trends, growing digitalisation, Government initiatives to drive digitalisation, benefits of ICT solutions as it reduces upfront investments, and the growing number of companies in the country. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  Some of the recent technological trends include the emergence of NPUs and their usage in personal computers as main processors as opposed to CPUs. NPUs are specialised ICT hardware components designed to handle AI-related tasks efficiently. This will revolutionise personal computers as NPUs can accelerate the use of operating systems that can perform AI-related tasks while consuming less energy, contributing to longer battery life, faster execution and enhanced user experience. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  In particular, Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s latest operating system, Windows 11, is built with Copilot. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  As Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s operating systems are the most commonly used in personal computers today, the shift towards Windows 11 will eventually encourage the adoption of NPUs in personal computers. This shift would consequently result in corporations and Government agencies upgrading their ICT hardware and software, which would create demand for ICT Solutions. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  We have already secured our first order to rent personal computers with NPUs that are AI-enabled since June 2024. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  Another recent industry trend includes the increased awareness and focus on environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability practices. In particular, Bursa Securities has required public listed companies on the ACE and Main Market to comply with their enhanced sustainability reporting requirements in order to encourage environmental sustainability and enhance their corporate sustainability reporting practices amongst public listed companies. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  As our Group offers CNCS as a value-added ICT service to complement our technology financing solution segment, and as an ICT service, we support our customers in achieving their environmental goals. CNCS enables our customers to retire greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware they have leased or rented from us by purchasing carbon credits. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  Further, our DaaS 360 has also been awarded the MyHIJAU Mark from the MGTC, which denotes that we comply with global environmental standards. We have also attained the ISO 14001:2015 certification, which denotes that we have a comprehensive framework to enhance our environmental management system and integrate sustainability into our business practices. This includes offering ICT Solutions that are designed to be durable, recyclable, and reusable. Thus, we are able to tap into the opportunities arising from the increased awareness and focus on environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability practices. (p. 126)\\n  \\n  As an ICT Solutions provider, our Group is well-positioned to capitalise and leverage on the outlook and growth opportunities. (p. 126)\\n\\n## 7.8 Operational Process Flow (p. 127)\\n\\n### 7.8.1 Technology financing solutions and trading of ICT hardware and software, and ICT services (p. 127)\\n\\nFigure: [no title] (p. 127)\\nThe diagram shows two parallel process flows. The first is for Technology financing solutions, which starts with assessment and evaluation, proposing a suitable solution, order confirmation/contract signing, procurement of ICT hardware/software, configuration, and delivery.

Accordingly, the revenue for the provision of cloud solutions and services to Haynik was included under the segment of Channel Partners, whereas the revenue contributed for the provision of technology financing, trading of ICT hardware and software as well as provision of ICT services to Haynik was included under the segment of Strategic Partners. (p. 138)\\n(2) All retail customers are secured/ recorded through our proprietary e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my (p. 138)\\n\\nOur sales and marketing department undertakes sales activities and maintain business relationships with stakeholders, as well as implements marketing strategies to create awareness of our ICT solutions and build our industry reputation. As at the LPD, we have 24 personnel in our sales and marketing department. We generate sales from the abovementioned customer segments through the following 3 approaches: (p. 138)\\n\\n- (i) **Maintaining business relationships with Strategic Partners and Channel Partners** (p. 138)\\n  We mainly sell our ICT Solutions through Strategic Partners and Channel Partners as we can leverage on: (p. 138)\\n  \\n  (a) their network of customers primarily in the Government sector; and (p. 138)\\n  \\n  (b) their resources to provide maintenance and technical support services to their customers for our leasing of ICT hardware and software transactions, thus allowing us to deploy our resources to customers. (p. 138)\\n  \\n  In turn, Strategic Partners and Channel Partners rely on us to provide: (p. 138)\\n  \\n  (a) a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions with options to finance their purchase through renting or leasing with us; and (p. 138)\\n\\n  (b) better pricing and terms to their customers as we are able to negotiate pricing and terms directly with the Principals as we are the Appointed Resellers of several established Principals. (p. 139)\\n  \\n  We also train all Channel Partners to fully understand the range of ICT Solutions we offer to enable them to anticipate, estimate and respond to end-users\\u2019 needs with appropriate and relevant ICT Solutions. (p. 139)\\n  \\n  For the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, we had secured orders and contracts through 34, 35, 34 and 16 Channel Partners, respectively. (p. 139)\\n  \\n  As at the LPD, we have signed strategic partnership agreements with 4 Strategic Partners to promote and resell ICT Solutions to end-users. In addition to the above arrangements, we also work closely with the Strategic Partners to establish pricing arrangements before they secure orders or contracts with their customers. (p. 139)\\n  \\n  The salient terms of the partnership agreements with the Strategic Partners generally include the following: (p. 139)\\n  \\n  (a) we are responsible to provide the Strategic Partners with ICT Solutions and if required, financing services. Meanwhile, the Strategic Partners are responsible for the marketing and securing of orders from their customers; (p. 139)\\n  \\n  (b) the Strategic Partners will provide us with the exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Nevertheless, we do not have to exclusively provide our services to the Strategic Partners; (p. 139)\\n  \\n  (c) the Strategic Partners have the responsibility to ensure that the periodic rental or lease payments for the use of ICT Solutions are paid directly to us; and (p. 139)\\n  \\n  (d) the agreements are in force until terminated by mutual agreement. (p. 139)\\n  \\n  We serve multiple end-customers through these Strategic Partners. During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, we have served 137, 129, 311 and 411 orders and contracts for 67, 71, 245 and 350 end-customers through our Strategic Partners for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. (p. 139)\\n\\n- (ii) **Directly approaching end-users** (p. 139)\\n  The direct approach entails sales or marketing activities which are carried out in-house and targeted directly at end-users. Our sales team\\u2019s primary objective is to promote the sale of our ICT Solutions to private and public corporations. (p. 139)\\n\\n- (iii) **Reaching out to retail customers through our e-commerce platform** (p. 139)\\n  Since February 2020, we have begun marketing refurbished ICT hardware via our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my. Our e-commerce platform allows us to target retail customers. (p. 139)\\n\\nApart from the above sales channels, we also engage in the following marketing activities to create awareness of our ICT Solutions and build our industry reputation to target end-users: (p. 139)\\n\\n- (iv) **Social media marketing** (p. 140)\\n  We invest in digital advertising on social media platforms, namely Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and LinkedIn, as well as search engines such as Google. We also invest in search engine optimisation to direct traffic relating to the products and services we offer to our website. (p. 140)\\n  \\n  In addition, we maintain a blog to discuss our views and insights about latest trends and developments in the industry. This showcases our knowledge in technology financing, allowing us to position ourselves as thought leaders and create awareness of our Group. (p. 140)\\n\\n- (v) **Digital and print advertising** (p. 140)\\n  We believe that showcasing our Group\\u2019s experience and knowledge has augmented our Group\\u2019s brand reputation in the ICT industry. We have thus contributed to and have been featured as subject matter experts in print media such as The Edge, Nanyang Siang Pau, The Star, Malaysiakini and Digital News Asia (DNA) during the Financial Years/Period Under Review. (p. 140)\\n\\n- (vi) **Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops** (p. 140)\\n  We organise and participate in events to meet new customers and keep abreast with latest market trends. Additionally, we also jointly host seminars with our Principals, to further gain brand exposure and to share the ICT Solutions we have available to potential customers. The events, seminars, talk shows and workshops that we have participated/hosted under ICT Zone in 2022 up to the LPD include the following: (p. 140)\\n\\nTable: Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops (p. 140-141)\\n- Year: 2025; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Securing your data | Essential strategies for businesses; Organiser: ICT Zone, National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA) and Securaze; Location: Virtual\\n- Year: 2024; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: LEAPing to the ACE Market: Strategy, Challenges, and Gains; Organiser: BFM 89.9; Location: Broadcast via radio\\n- Year: 2024; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: New opportunities for ICT Zone in a competitive market; Organiser: BFM 89.9; Location: Broadcasted via radio\\n- Year: 2024; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: CNCS Launching Event; Organiser: ICT Zone and HP Inc.; Location: Kuala Lumpur\\n- Year: 2024; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: The Boss Has Something To Say: ICT Zone\\u2019s move to Leap Market is full of challenges; Organiser: CITYplus FM; Location: Broadcasted via radio\\n- Year: 2024; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: PIKOM Digital Excellence Awards Night 2024; Organiser: PIKOM; Location: Selangor\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Top in Tech Innovation Awards 2022; Organiser: Malaysiakini and Digital News Asia; Location: Selangor\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: ICT Zone Asia Berhad, Making Work Computing Affordable; Organiser: BFM 89.9; Location: Broadcasted via radio\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Starza\\u2019s Technology Innovation Event with ICT Zone, Hewlett-Packard and Intel; Organiser: Starza Corporation, HP Inc. and Intel Corporation; Location: Johor\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Starza's Technology Innovation Event with ICT Zone, Hewlett-Packard and Intel; Organiser: Starza Corporation, HP Inc. and Intel Corporation; Location: Putrajaya\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: SME Growth Summit 2023; Organiser: Malaysiakini, Kakitangan.com and Digital News Asia; Location: Selangor\\n- Year: 2023; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Top In Tech Ep38: Carbon Credits: A Win-Win for Sustainability and Business?; Organiser: Malaysiakini and Digital News Asia; Location: Virtual\\n- Year: 2022; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: DaaS 360 | The Impeccable Productivity with Microsoft 365 Rather Than Just \\u201cMicrosoft Office\\u201d; Organiser: Microsoft Corporation and ICT Zone; Location: Kuala Lumpur\\n- Year: 2022; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Top in Tech Ep29: The Intersection of Sustainability & Technology; Organiser: Malaysiakini and Digital News Asia; Location: Virtual\\n- Year: 2022; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Bridge the gap between Productivity & sustainability with DaaS (Device-as-a-Service); Organiser: HP Inc. and ICT Zone; Location: Kuala Lumpur\\n- Year: 2022; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Reimagine productivity with Microsoft 365 DaaS | Safeguard Your Business In the Era of Digital Transformation; Organiser: Microsoft Corporation and ICT Zone; Location: Virtual\\n- Year: 2022; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Dell Technologies Webinar: Smart Devices | Incomparable Productivity with an Unbeatable Experience; Organiser: Dell Technologies Inc., ICT Zone and M-Link System (M) Sdn Bhd; Location: Virtual\\n- Year: 2021; Events, seminars, talk shows and workshops: Top in Tech Innovation Award 2021; Organiser: Malaysiakini; Location: Kuala Lumpur\\n\\nIn addition, we also participate in events organised by our Principals to maintain our relationship with our Principals and to meet other ICT Solution or service providers which we may collaborate with in the future.

Our top 5 customers for the FYE 2022 to FYE 2024 and FPE 2024 contributed to the majority of our revenue, representing 81.53%, 83.24%, 86.24% and 84.93% of our total revenue. Starza, Juricco and Haynik, who are our Strategic Partners, were consistently our top 5 customers during the Financial Years/Period Under Review, collectively contributing 77.01%, 76.26%, 77.38% and 77.69% in the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively.

As such, the total number of end-customers our Group serves through these Strategic Partners will not tally with the total aggregate number of end-customers of each Strategic Partners in the table above. (p. 145)\\n\\nNevertheless, we expect our revenue generated from the abovementioned companies to continue to represent a sizable portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future, premised on us having mutually beneficial and interdependent business relationships with them. Pursuant to the terms of the strategic partnership agreements (as detailed in Section 7.25 of this Prospectus), we leverage on our Strategic Partners\\u2019 continued support in distributing and promoting our ICT Solutions through our exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Meanwhile, our Strategic Partners rely on us to provide: (p. 146)\\n\\n- (i) a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions with options to finance their purchase through renting or leasing with us; and (p. 146)\\n- (ii) better pricing and terms to their customers as we are able to negotiate pricing and terms directly with the Principals as we are the Appointed Resellers of several established Principals.

Through such achievement, we have built good working relationships with our Strategic Partners, having had more than 10 years of business relationships with each of them. (p. 146)\\n\\nIn mitigating our dependency on our Strategic Partners, we have been building, and will continue to build, our customer base of private and public corporations, and retail customers. We have secured orders from other customers during the Financial Years/Period Under Review. Aside from our 4 Strategic Partners, our Group secured orders and contracts from 122, 160, 221 and 277 customers for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. Our wide customer base indicates that we are able to secure orders and contracts from other customers aside from our Strategic Partners.

(p. 149)\\n\\nDuring the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our major suppliers, i.e. Tec D Distribution (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, VSTECS Group and Ingram Micro Malaysia, contributed more than 10.00% to our purchases. Details of these companies are as follows: (p. 149)\\n\\nTable: Major supplier Description (p. 149)\\n- Major supplier: Tec D Distribution (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd; Description: Tec D Distribution (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd is principally involved in the distribution and marketing of computer and computer related products and the provision of installation and maintenance services.

The companies supplied ICT hardware such as computers, laptops, printers, projectors and related peripheral devices and software such as operating systems and application software during the Financial Years/Period Under Review\\n- Major supplier: Ingram Micro Malaysia Sdn Bhd; Description: Ingram Micro Malaysia Sdn Bhd is principally involved in the sale of computer hardware and software and peripherals, distribution of wireless devices and provision of outsourced logistics devices. The company supplied ICT hardware such as computers, laptops, printers, projectors and related peripheral devices and software such as operating systems and application software during the Financial Years/Period Under Review\\n- Major supplier: M-Link System (M) Sdn Bhd; Description: M-Link System Sdn Bhd is principally involved in the wholesale of computer, hardware, software and peripherals. The company supplied ICT hardware such as computers, laptops, printers, projectors and related peripheral devices and software such as operating systems and application software during the Financial Years/Period Under Review\\n\\nDespite their contribution to our Group\\u2019s total purchases, our Group is not dependent on these major suppliers due to the following reasons: (p. 150)\\n\\n- (i) The brands of ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions purchased from these suppliers are readily available in the market, and can be obtained from other Distributors. Tec D Distribution (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, VSTECS Group and Ingram Micro Malaysia each carry several brands of ICT hardware and software. Some of these brands of ICT hardware and software can be sourced from other Principals\\u2019 Distributors or directly from the Principals. Alternatively, we may also source for other brands of ICT hardware and software in the market. Thus, in the event that these suppliers cease selling to us, we can easily source for similar products and/or services from other suppliers in the market, or directly from the Principals; and (p. 150)\\n- (ii) The Principal(s) generally do not specify which of their Distributor(s) we have to procure ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions from. Thus, we can procure from any Distributors that provide us better pricing arrangements and credit terms. (p. 150)\\n\\nThe percentage of purchases from these suppliers are high because we chose to purchase ICT hardware and software from them in bulk out of convenience and familiarity. (p. 150)\\n\\n## 7.16 Interruptions to Business and Impact of Covid-19 on Our Business Operations (p. 150)\\n\\nOur Group has not experienced any interruption in our business and operations which had a significant effect on our business and operations during the past 12 months preceding the LPD. (p. 150)\\n\\nDuring the MCOs and lockdowns implemented throughout 2020 and 2021, all Government and private premises were required to be closed and to cease operations except those involved in essential services. While we were not allowed to operate in our offices in Malaysia at this time, it did not have any major material impact on our business operations as our employees worked remotely from home. All deliveries of ICT Solutions were handled by third-party delivery providers and our Group had the necessary approvals to commute should they need to carry out any ICT services at customers\\u2019 premises. (p. 150)\\n\\nIn 2020 and 2021, we experienced delays in shipment of ICT hardware, which have resulted in delays of up to 6 months in delivering technology solutions, and cloud solutions and services to our customers. These delays were largely contributed by a shortage in components used by our Principals to manufacture the ICT hardware. The shortage in components was due to the global shortage in microchips as fabrication activities were disrupted when foundries could not operate due to the national lockdowns, and imposition of tariff barriers to restrict companies in both the United States and China from trading. Nevertheless, this did not materially impact our business operations as the supply disruption was industry-wide. (p. 150)\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic played a part in driving the digital economy as many corporations implemented work-from-home policies during the MCO and National Recovery Plan, which gave rise to the use of digital tools to enable file sharing, virtual video and audio teleconferencing and project management applications. These digital tools require the use of ICT Solutions. As such, we benefitted from the growth of the industry during the period. (p. 150)\\n\\nOur Group\\u2019s revenues continued to improve from RM33.74 million in FYE 2019 to RM52.03 million in FYE 2022. (p. 150)\\n\\nMalaysia has entered into the \\u201cTransition to Endemic\\u201d phase since 1 April 2022, and \\u201cEndemic\\u201d phase since 1 May 2022. Since then, all restrictions limiting business operating hours and number of employees in a workplace have been uplifted. Our Group does not expect that it will face any material operational disruptions moving forward as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(p. 184)\\n\\nIn the past, our Group has not encountered any difficulties in renewing the licences, permits and approvals, where applicable. (p. 184)\\n\\n## 7.23 ESG (p. 185)\\n\\nOur Group recognises the importance of ensuring sustainable growth and development for our Group. As such, on June 2024, we have established our Group\\u2019s Sustainability Policy which focuses on business practices addressing relevant ESG issues. Among the ESG measures and practices implemented include the following: (p. 185)\\n\\n- (i) **Environmental** (p. 185)\\n  Under our Group\\u2019s Sustainability Policy, we are committed to identifying, managing and minimising the environmental impact of our Group\\u2019s business operations. Thus, we have adopted responsible approaches in our daily operations to promote environmental sustainability. These approaches include: (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (a) **Enabling our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives** (p. 185)\\n  We enable our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives by offering CNCS, which is a \\u201cgreen\\u201d ICT Solutions. CNCS involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent to corporations and Government agencies. In this regard, we participate in the Bursa Carbon Exchange to purchase carbon credits, which are thereafter used to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent. (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (b) **Reducing consumption of non-renewable and non-recyclable materials, and encouraging the use of renewable resources** (p. 185)\\n  We rent or sell refurbished ICT hardware to customers. Refurbished ICT hardware extends the life of existing devices, thus reducing manufacturing activities of new ICT hardware, which consumes considerably high energy and emits greenhouse gasses. Thus, refurbished ICT hardware can reduce carbon footprint. Refurbished ICT hardware are also generally relatively cheaper than new ICT hardware, thus making it more accessible to corporations. (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (c) **Minimising the level of pollutants entering into the air and water from daily business operations** (p. 185)\\n  We promote personal hygiene practices among our employees, as well as food hygiene when handling food as an effort to reduce pollutants in our business premise. (p. 185)\\n  \\n  As a result of the above measures and practices, we have obtained various awards and recognitions including: (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (a) ISO 14001:2015 certification, which denotes that our Group has a comprehensive framework to enhance our environmental management system and integrate sustainability into our business practices; (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (b) MyHIJAU certification for DaaS 360 MyHIJAU is a green recognition scheme endorsed by the MGTC; (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (c) 2024 PIKOM Digital Excellence Award in ESG, which recognises our sustainable business practices; (p. 185)\\n  \\n  (d) \\u201cCommitted\\u201d rating for our performance ESG practices and measures by EcoVadis, one of the world\\u2019s largest and most trusted provider of business sustainability ratings; and (p. 185)\\n\\n  (e) Amplify Impact Catalyst 4-Star Partner by HP Inc., in recognition that we have demonstrated our commitment to their ESG goals. (p. 186)\\n  \\n  Apart from the above, we also carry out risk assessments regularly to identify potential risks caused by our business operations that may lead to detrimental damage to the environment. Additionally, we also look for opportunities to develop strategies aimed to overcome these potential risks. (p. 186)\\n\\n- (ii) **Social** (p. 186)\\n  We are aware that our employees are valuable assets and as such, we strive to retain and nurture skilled talent. Additionally, we place emphasis on social interaction, cultural enrichment and social diversity. Among the practices we have implemented includes the following: (p. 186)\\n  \\n  (a) **Maintaining a safe workforce** (p. 186)\\n  We implement various safety measures for our employees, including employees who handle ICT hardware, to prevent accidents and injuries at our business premise. (p. 186)\\n  \\n  (b) **Utilising training and development programs to upskill our employees** (p. 186)\\n  We organise and sponsor training and development programs to ensure our employees are up-to-date with the latest technology and trends. Through these programs, employees are also able to learn new skills. (p. 186)\\n  \\n  (c) **Enabling employees to develop their professional skills** (p. 186)\\n  We promote personal development among employees as an effort to improve work-life balance as well as to foster a positive work environment. We support employees who are interested in developing their professional skills to allow them to reach their full potential. (p. 186)\\n  \\n  (d) **Promoting equality and diversity** (p. 186)\\n  We provide equal opportunity to individuals from diverse backgrounds in our recruitment process, whereby we provide job opportunities solely based on individual merit. Thus, our workforce comprises individuals of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities. We aim to have a workplace culture where all employees, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion or gender, feel valued, respected and accepted and are encouraged to share their ideas. (p. 186)\\n  \\n  Apart from the above, we also contribute back to the society by participating in sponsorships. For the Financial Years/Period Under Review, we have sponsored monetary funds to the Pan Malaysia Global Taekwon-do Federation National Tournament No. 3 and ICT hardware to Nian Shao Qing Youth Club when theirs were damaged due to lack of use during the COVID-19 pandemic. (p. 186)\\n\\n- (iii) **Governance** (p. 186)\\n  We are committed to conduct our business ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in Malaysia. These laws include but are not limited to the Employment Act 1955, Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 and the Companies Act 2016. (p. 186)\\n\\n  We also have an anti-bribery and corruption policy and have put in place policies and procedures to maintain compliance with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 and its amendments. (p. 187)\\n\\n  In addition to the above, under our Sustainability Policy, we have implemented governance sustainability measures into all function and processes of our Group including strategic planning, accountability, sustainable planning as well as development. Among these measures includes the following: (p. 187)\\n  \\n  (a) **Placing emphasis on sustainability into our Group\\u2019s strategic planning** (p. 187)\\n  We have embedded our Sustainability Policy into our business strategy. As such, we place emphasis on ESG factors during strategic planning stages. (p. 187)\\n  \\n  (b) **Establishing and improving governance structures and processes** (p. 187)\\n  Our Group actively oversees our Sustainability Policy and the performance of the policy. As such, we will review and update our policies as needed to ensure they align with our Group\\u2019s goals. (p. 187)\\n  \\n  To this end, our Group\\u2019s sustainability efforts are aimed at improving our value proposition for our stakeholders through the adoption of best practices. Our Group closely monitors industry trends and adopts new strategies accordingly in order to remain relevant and competitive. By prioritising sustainability, our Group aims to create long-term value for our business and contribute positively to society.

(p. 196)\\n- Return of Equipment: At the end of any Third-Party Agreement, the Strategic Partner shall be obligated to return the ICT equipment to ICT Zone Ventures at the Strategic Partner\\u2019s expense. Any freight, insurance or customs charges related to the rental equipment incurred during or at the end of the rental will be billed to the Strategic Partner\\u2019s account. (p. 197)\\n- Governing law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed for all purposes and any claim hereunder shall be in accordance with the laws of Malaysia. (p. 197)\\n\\nFor information purposes, there are no specific termination and default clauses for the strategic partnership agreements. Nevertheless, common law principles allow for the strategic partners to terminate such agreements by giving reasonable notice. In mitigating the risk of termination of the strategic partnership agreements, our Group has been building, and will continue to build our pool of Strategic Partners, Channel Partners and end-users (in particular, private and public corporations and retail customers (as set out in Section 7.26.1(ii) of this Prospectus)) to reduce our reliance on our Strategic Partners. In addition, while the strategic partnership agreements do not expressly spell out the remedies available to our Group in the event of a breach of the terms of the agreement by the Strategic Partner, the following are some of the remedies available to our Group by law: (p. 197)\\n\\n(a) termination of the agreement if the Strategic Partner refuses to perform its obligations (pursuant to Section 40 of the Contracts Act 1950); and/or (p. 197)\\n\\n(b) bringing of a claim against the Strategic Partner to recover any loss or damage suffered by our Group as a result of the breach or which the parties knew, when they made the agreement, to be likely to result from the breach of it (pursuant to Section 74 of the Contracts Act 1950). (p. 197)\\n\\nFor avoidance of doubt, in relation to the terms of the strategic partnership agreements (including the exclusivity rights granted by the Strategic Partners to our Group), our Group is not in contravention of: (p. 197)\\n\\n(a) any laws in Malaysia, including the Act and Competition Act 2010; and (p. 197)\\n\\n(b) any Bumiputera policies in Malaysia. (p. 197)\\n\\n## 7.26 Business Strategies and Future Plans (p. 197)\\n\\n### 7.26.1 We intend to continuously grow our technology financing solutions (p. 197)\\n\\nOur technology financing solution segment is presently a major business segment that contributes to our GP. During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our technology financing solution segment is the largest contributor to our GP, having contributed between 66.11% and 81.02% to our Group\\u2019s GP. (p. 197)\\n\\nAccording to the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the ICT services industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2025 and 2027. This growth is expected to be driven by new technological evolutions and industry trends such as the emergence of NPUs and their usage in personal computers as well as increased awareness and focus on environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability practices. The industry is also expected to be driven by the growing digitalisation and adoption of cloud computing in the country, Government initiatives to drive digitalisation, benefits of technology financing solutions as it reduces upfront investments, and the growing number of companies in the country. (p. 197)\\n\\nAs we are an ICT Solution provider that can provide new and existing customers with a diverse range of ICT hardware and software, we expect to benefit from the shift towards the use of NPUs in personal computers. As mentioned in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s latest operating system, Windows 11, is built with Copilot. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency. As Microsoft Corporation\\u2019s operating systems are the most commonly used operating system in personal computers today, and the shift towards Windows 11 will eventually encourage the adoption of NPUs in personal computers. This shift would consequently result in corporations and Government agencies upgrading their ICT hardware and software, which would create demand for ICT Solutions. We have already secured our first technology financing solution contract for NPU-enabled personal computers in June 2024. (p. 198)\\n\\nFurther, our CNCS coupled with our DaaS 360 receiving the MyHIJAU Mark and our Group complying with the ISO 14001:2015 certification is expected to enable us to tap into the opportunities arising from increased awareness and focus on environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability practices. (p. 198)\\n\\nWe thus intend to capitalise and leverage on the abovementioned industry growth opportunities through: (p. 198)\\n\\n- (i) **Investing in new ICT hardware and software to cater for increasing demand from new and existing customers** (p. 198)\\n  We have allocated RM18.50 million of our IPO Proceeds to purchase ICT hardware and software to support the growth of our technology financing solution business. This will be used to procure approximately 4,000 units of computers and laptops alongside a corresponding number of related peripheral devices such as mice, keyboards, monitors and security locks. It will also be used to procure ICT software such as operating systems, device management and computer security software that protects the ICT Solutions against computer viruses, malware, spyware and/or adware. The ICT software procured from third party providers will be bundled with the ICT hardware to provide value-added services such as proactive and analytical services, remote managed services, device recovery services and CNCS. (p. 198)\\n  \\n  We will also purchase new ICT hardware and software by leveraging on financing from financial institutions. To this end, we have allocated RM1.14 million of the IPO Proceeds for finance costs incurred in securing such financing such as processing fees, brokerage fees and other fees/incidental expenses when obtaining the financing facilities from financial institutions. It will also be used to place a principal amount of up to 2 months of the instalment amount with the financial institutions before obtaining the financial facilities. (p. 198)\\n  \\n  In light of the expected growth in orders and contracts secured for our technology financing solution segment, we also expect the legal costs to rise due to increased number of leasing and rental orders and contracts entered into between the ICT Zone Asia Group with our customers. Such legal costs include professional fees and stamp duty for execution of agreements. To this end, we have allocated RM0.75 million from our IPO Proceeds to defray such expenses. (p. 198)\\n  \\n  In addition, we also intend to purchase equipment all-risks insurance policies for the ICT hardware leased or rented out. Such insurance coverage covers loss of or damages to the ICT hardware as a result of, amongst others, fire, theft or any accidental damage during the period of insurance. We have allocated RM0.61 million of the IPO Proceeds for this purpose. (p. 198)\\n\\n- (ii) **Expanding our customer base of private and public corporations, and retail customers by actively investing in marketing activities** (p. 199)\\n  In the past, a majority of our orders and contracts have been secured with Strategic Partners and Channel Partners. As such, moving forward, we intend to expand our customer base of end-users comprising private and public corporations, and retail customers. (p. 199)\\n  \\n  We intend to undertake marketing activities to actively target and directly approach these end-users. The marketing activities will enable us to increase our market visibility and brand recognition. By doing so, this will improve confidence in our company to provide ICT Solutions, thereby allowing our sales team to easily approach them. (p. 199)\\n  \\n  These marketing activities include digital marketing efforts on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok as well as search engine marketing on Google and Bing. In addition, we also intend to invest in amongst others, media advertising, telemarketing, email marketing, event marketing and content marketing strategies. To this end, we intend to allocate RM0.33 million of the IPO Proceeds for these marketing activities, amongst other sales activities that are further elaborated in Section 4.8 of this Prospectus. (p. 199)\\n\\n### 7.26.2 We intend to expand our ICT trading segment through the sale of refurbished ICT hardware (p. 199)\\n\\nWe intend to expand our ICT trading segment through the sale of refurbished ICT hardware. In particular, we intend to grow our customer base for the trading of refurbished ICT hardware through collaborations. (p. 199)\\n\\nAs at the LPD, we have been approved as a registered vendor by Angkasa (which is an apex cooperative recognised by the Government to represent the Malaysia Cooperative Movement), whereby Angkasa members can purchase refurbished ICT hardware from us via an instalment plan of 12 months. This allows us to leverage upon Angkasa\\u2019s network of members of 7.2 million members as at December 2023. (p. 199)\\n\\nAs such, Angkasa members will be able to utilise our refurbished ICT hardware without needing to pay the full amount on an upfront basis. Meanwhile, the monthly instalment fee will be automatically deducted from the respective Angkasa members\\u2019 salary on a monthly basis using Angkasa\\u2019s auto-deduct system. We have rolled out this instalment plan to Angkasa members since October 2023. (p. 199)\\n\\nIn order to grow our sales of refurbished ICT hardware from Angkasa members, we have rolled out a pilot version of an online platform on www.komputermurah.my dedicated for Angkasa members which is known as Sahabatku. We presently reach out to Angkasa members directly by conducting roadshows or directly contacting them or through an agent. Sahabatku will allow Angkasa members to purchase our refurbished ICT hardware via our online platform. Thus, this will allow us to easily reach out to Angkasa members digitally as opposed to conducting roadshows at Government offices to create awareness of our products and services. (p. 199)\\n\\nThe online platform will also be integrated with Angkasa\\u2019s auto-deduct system and payment gateway system to enable Angkasa members to purchase refurbished ICT hardware on an instalment basis. As Sahabatku will offer instalment plans, the pricing of the ICT hardware listed on Sahabatku will differ from those offered on www.komputermurah.my which are sold on an outright basis. (p. 199)\\n\\nThe cost of setting up Sahabatku is estimated to be RM50,000 and will be funded via internally generated funds. We intend to officially launch Sahabatku in the first half of 2025. (p. 199)\\n\\nFurther, we also intend to reward referrals of refurbished ICT hardware sold through Sahabatku. This would enable us to encourage retail customers to refer our e-commerce platform to new customers, thus allowing us to expand our customer base. (p. 200)\\n\\nWe will continue to seek for potential strategic collaborations to expand our customer base for our ICT trading segment. (p. 200)\\n\\n### 7.26.3 We plan to extend our ICT services offering (p. 200)\\n\\nOur technology financing solution business promotes technology servitisation, which involves providing corporations and Government agencies access to ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud solutions and services which are bundled with the relevant ICT services, without having to incur high capital expenditure. Over the years, we have been extending the range of value-added services offered with our technology financing solution business from just managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services, to providing proactive and analytical services for devices, data backup and device recovery services, security management and CNCS. (p. 200)\\n\\nOne of our value-added services, CNCS, has been recently introduced. Since March 2024, we have been conducting a pilot project for one of our existing customers whereby we have purchased carbon credits to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we have leased to them. We have thus far retired 477.943 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions with 481 carbon credits as at the LPD. We have since launched CNCS to all of our customers in July 2024. (p. 200)\\n\\nWe intend to further extend the range of ICT services we offer by offering remote managed services. Remote managed services will benefit our customers in terms of being able to promptly and remotely rectify software issues and perform software upgrades and updates. As our operations personnel will be able to remotely carry out any rectifications, upgrades or updates, our customers need not wait for an appointment to be made for an on-site visit to their premises. We will provide an alternative service offering to customers of our existing maintenance and technical support services which is currently being provided at our customers\\u2019 premises. (p. 200)\\n\\nIn the meantime, as we will be able to centralise the management of our customers\\u2019 ICT hardware through a single system, this will enable us to cater to more customers. It will also reduce our costs as our operations personnel will be able to handle more customers in a shorter time span and will minimise travelling expenses to our customers\\u2019 premises. (p. 200)\\n\\nAs at the LPD, we have presently identified a suitable system to facilitate the remote management services. We are presently working with the system provider to configure and test the system to ensure that it meets our operational needs. The configuration and testing of the system commenced since July 2024. The annual cost to be incurred may vary depending on the number of users of the said system. (p. 200)\\n\\nAs at the LPD, we have 2 personnel that can provide remote managed services. (p. 200)\\n\\nWe plan to begin offering remote managed services by the first half of 2025, barring any unforeseen circumstances. (p. 200)\\n\\n### 7.26.4 We intend to expand via acquisitions, collaborations and/or joint ventures (p. 201)\\n\\nWe intend to acquire and/or undertake strategic collaborations and/or joint ventures with other ICT Solution or service providers involved in similar or complementary activities to our existing core businesses, who can provide additional revenue streams while enhancing our competitive advantage. Such businesses may include companies which are involved in technology financing but are mainly focused in the retail segment (i.e. similar business) or companies which offer software that can be bundled with our Group\\u2019s offerings (i.e. complementary business). We intend to target companies based in Malaysia. This will enable us to broaden our service offerings, expand our customer base while contributing to incremental growth of our Group. (p. 201)\\n\\nAs at the LPD, we have yet to identify any potential mergers and acquisitions, strategic collaborations and/or joint venture opportunities. (p. 201)\\n\\nPrior to acquiring, collaborating and/or undertaking joint ventures, we will first consider criteria such as valuation, capital requirement, business synergies, potential value creation to our existing business as well as expected return on investment. We expect to identify a potential merger or acquisition, strategic collaboration and/or joint venture within the next 3 years and intend to fund such acquisitions, collaborations and/or joint ventures via our internally generated funds and/or external borrowings.

The following is a summary of the key risk factors that we face in our business operations: (p. 32)\\n\\n(i) We are dependent on some of our Strategic Partners\\nWe are dependent on our Strategic Partners, namely Starza, Juricco and Haynik, to deliver ICT Solutions to Government-linked corporations and agencies. These Strategic Partners were consistently ranked as part of our top 5 customers during each of the Financial Years/Period Under Review. As such, we are exposed to risks that if we fail to secure additional orders or contracts with them in the future or encounter delays in payments or non payments from end-users of orders and contracts secured through these Strategic Partners.

      "2025-09-07 22:28:18,979 - ontology_construction - DEBUG - System Prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "\n",
      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "The following key-value pairs aid in interpreting the source text. Apply these mappings when extracting and storing entities and relationships to maintain consistency and accuracy. This means that if your extraction involves translating a key into its representative value—for example, if the key is `CYT` and the value is `Choo Yan Tiee, the Promoter, Specified Shareholder, major shareholder, Executive Director and Managing Director of our Company`—then instead of extracting `CYT` as the entity name, you should extract `Choo Yan Tiee` as the entity name.\n",

      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "# 9 RISK FACTORS\n",
      "\n",
      "YOU SHOULD EVALUATE AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY, ALONG WITH OTHER MATTERS IN THIS PROSPECTUS, THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE, IN ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS, BEFORE MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR OUR IPO SHARES. (p. 195)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 9.1 Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations (p. 195)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(i) We are dependent on some of our Strategic Partners** (p. 195)\n",
      "\n",
      "  We are dependent on our Strategic Partners, namely Starza, Juricco and Haynik, to deliver ICT Solutions to Government-linked corporations and agencies. These Strategic Partners were consistently ranked as part of our top 5 customers during each of the Financial Years/Period Under Review. Collectively, they contributed 77.01%, 76.26%, 77.38% and 77.69% of our revenue in the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. Please refer to Section 7.14 of this Prospectus for the detailed breakdown of the purchases from these companies during the Financial Years/Period Under Review.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As such, we are exposed to risks that if we fail to secure additional orders or contracts with them in the future or encounter delays in payments or non-payments from end-users of orders and contracts secured through these Strategic Partners. Should this occur, this may adversely affect our Group’s business operations and financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Pursuant to the terms of the strategic partnership agreements entered with these Strategic Partners (as detailed in Section 7.25 of this Prospectus), we leverage on these Strategic Partners’ continued support in distributing and promoting our ICT Solutions through our exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Meanwhile, our Strategic Partners rely on us to provide:\n",
      "\n",
      "  - (i) a comprehensive range of ICT Solutions with options to finance their purchase through renting or leasing with us via our technology financing solution orders or contracts; and\n",
      "\n",
      "  - (ii) better pricing and terms for their customers as we are able to negotiate pricing and terms directly with the Principals as we are the Appointed Resellers of several established Principals.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Although our relationship with these Strategic Partners are mutually beneficial, we are exposed to risks that these Strategic Partners may terminate their strategic partnership agreements with us. For information, there is also no specific termination and default clauses provided in the strategic partnership agreements with these Strategic Partners which provide that the agreements shall continue to be in force until terminated by mutual agreement. Should this occur, this may adversely affect our Group’s business operations and financial performance as a substantial percentage of our Group’s revenues were generated from these Strategic Partners during the Financial Years/Period Under Review. The extent of this impact will depend on our ability to channel our resources to secure other customers in a timely manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, a significant amount of our order book for our technology financing are presently generated from these Strategic Partners. As at the LPD, RM179.61 million or 75.92% of the total order book for technology financing amounting to RM236.57 million is contributed by the Strategic Partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Thus, if any of these customers cease to be a Strategic Partner, there may be a potential revenue loss to our Group and a negative impact on our orderbook. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the business relationship, secure future orders or contracts, or receive prompt payments from the end-users of orders or contracts secured through them.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(ii) Our growth depends on our ability to secure and renew orders and contracts** (p. 196)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Due to the nature of our business operations, our future growth, financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to consistently secure orders and contracts from existing and new customers for the provision of ICT Solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our technology financing solution order and contract tenure may be up to 5 years. Meanwhile, our ICT services and cloud solutions and services may either be secured on a contract basis which spans up to 5 years, or secured on a purchase order basis. Any difficulties in securing new customers, or renewal or additional orders or contracts from existing customers, in a timely manner may adversely affect our business and financial performance. As at the LPD, our order book stood at RM242.81 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We do not enter into long-term contracts with our clients for our implementation services due to the rapid technological changes and market trends of the industry in which our clients operate in. As for our maintenance, support and professional services contracts, the tenure of the contracts is slightly longer, but we are subject to termination or reduction of our services by the clients in the event that there are changes to the clients’ strategies or changes in the enterprise IT solutions required for their operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, the volume and size of orders or contracts are subject to several factors, which include, among others, economic downturns, industry-specific slowdowns and customers’ financial constraints. Should we be unable to secure new orders and contracts of similar or greater volume and size, our financial performance may also be adversely impacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(iii) Our technology financing solution business is capital intensive** (p. 196)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our technology financing solution business requires financial capital for the purchase of ICT hardware and software to be leased or rented. As such, the prospective growth of our technology financing solution business is dependent on, amongst others, our ability to secure additional funding and financing to support our additional capital requirements. If we are unable to secure additional funding and financing or if such additional funding and financing is only available on terms that are less favourable than the terms of our current capital, our ability to grow our technology financing solution business may be adversely impacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our financial capital was mainly funded and financed by multiple sources of capital, amongst others, our Group’s internally generated funds and bank borrowings obtained from the financial institutions and leasing companies, as well as capital raised from equity capital market in the Private Placement. Please refer to Section 12.6 of this Prospectus for details of the sources of funds for our financial capital over the Financial Years/Period Under Review.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We have also allocated RM18.50 million of our IPO Proceeds to purchase ICT hardware and software for our technology financing solution business. Please refer to Section 4.8 of this Prospectus for details of the utilisation of our IPO Proceeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our ability to obtain additional funding and financing and the costs of capital of such funding and financing are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions, monetary and fiscal policies as determined by the Government, credit availability from financial institutions, cost of financing of financial institutions, our continued success of operations as well as our financial performance and position. If we are unable to raise adequate funding and financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, growth, operations and prospects could be adversely affected. (p. 196)\n",
      "\n",
      "  There is no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to purchase the ICT hardware and software required to expand our technology financing solution business in the future. (p. 197)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(iv) We face credit and liquidity risks if there are delays in collection or non recoverability of trade receivables** (p. 197)\n",
      "\n",
      "  The customers and/or end-users of our technology financing solutions and cloud solutions and services segments are required to pay rental fees, leasing fees, cloud platform rental fees or cloud solution fees on a monthly basis. Generally, we grant credit terms of up to 60 days to our customers. Other credit terms are assessed and approved on a case-by case basis after taking into consideration various factors such as our customers’ historical payment trend, creditworthiness, the quantum of the amount owed, and the length of their business relationship with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As such, we are exposed to risks of delays in collection or non-recoverability of our trade receivables. Should this occur, we may have to make an allowance for doubtful debts or write off bad debts, which may adversely impact our financial performance and position.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As our business requires substantial financial capital to purchase ICT hardware and software, our Group’s liquidity is dependent on our ability to manage our financial capital. If we receive an increase in demand for technology financing solutions and/or cloud solutions and services from customers, a delay in collection or non-recoverability of trade receivables may restrict our ability to pursue such business opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As at 30 November 2024, RM2.72 million or 20.67% of our trade receivables were past the credit period granted to our customers. During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, we did not experience any delay in collection or non-recoverability of trade receivables that had a material adverse impact on our Group’s financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Despite the above, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience minimal payment delays and recover all past-due trade receivables, which would significantly impact our Group’s financial performance and position.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(v) Our business could suffer if we are unable to recruit and retain our key senior management personnel and qualified technical personnel** (p. 197)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our success and future growth will depend on the expertise and continuing efforts of our key senior management, namely our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang; our Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Vincent Ng Soon Kiat; our General Manager, Admin and Finance, Teh Siow Voon; our Accountant, Cheah Chin Mon; our Assistant General Manager, Operations Support, Lau Yeo Chuan; and Chief Executive Officer of HaaS, Loh Kuo Hsiung.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our key senior management team has extensive experience across a broad spectrum of business activities, from operations to finance to sales and marketing. Their experience, drive and passion for our business have been instrumental to our Group’s vision and growth strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As such, a loss of our key senior management without suitable and timely replacement may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial performance and position. Although we have put in place management succession plans, as detailed in Section 5.9 of the Prospectus, there can be no assurance that the loss of our key senior management will not adversely and materially impact our Group’s business, prospects, financial performance and position. (p. 197)\n",
      "\n",
      "  In addition, our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with the right technical expertise, professional integrity and commitment. There is no assurance that our present efforts in recruiting and retaining talent will result in the successful recruitment and retention of our suitable qualified employees. The potential loss of these personnel and our inability to promptly secure suitable replacements could disrupt our deliverables to our customers. Further, if we lose our employees to our competitors, our competitiveness, business operations and ability to grow may also be adversely affected. (p. 198)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(vi) Our technology financing solution business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates** (p. 198)\n",
      "\n",
      "  As a large portion of our Group’s working capital is sourced from local financial institutions, our borrowing cost is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates. As at the LPD, our Group’s total outstanding bank borrowings was RM99.85 million, all of which are based on a floating interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our Group’s borrowing cost is thus dependent on interest rates imposed by financial institutions which, in turn, are guided by prevailing monetary policy and OPR imposed by the Bank Negara Malaysia. An increase in interest rates imposed will lead to an increase in our Group’s borrowing cost and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Based on our Group’s total outstanding bank borrowings of RM99.85 million as at the LPD, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rate would lead to an increase in interests of approximately RM1.00 million per annum, assuming all other variables are constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There is no assurance that our financial performance will not impacted by substantial changes in interest rates of our bank borrowings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(vii) Our refurbished ICT hardware may become obsolete** (p. 198)\n",
      "\n",
      "  ICT hardware manufacturers and semiconductor design houses constantly develop new product designs to keep up with changing market trends and remain relevant in the ICT industry. In doing so, new ICT hardware models with more advanced specifications are constantly being introduced into the market. An introduction of a new ICT hardware model with more advanced specifications could reduce the prices of preceding ICT hardware models, or result in obsolesces of the preceding ICT hardware models.\n",
      "\n",
      "  While we keep abreast with the latest technological changes relevant to our industry, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate an introduction of a new ICT hardware model with more advanced specifications which would render the ICT hardware models we have refurbished for rental or lease to our customers obsolete or reduce the demand for these refurbished ICT hardware. Should these refurbished ICT hardware be deemed obsolete, or should there be lower demand for the ICT hardware models due to the introduction of a more advanced ICT hardware model, we will have to dispose or sell the refurbished ICT hardware. In the event we have to dispose or sell these refurbished ICT hardware below its net book value, this could result in losses, which would adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, the Group registered a loss on the disposal of ICT hardware of RM45,440, RM95,106, RM20,390 and RM54,552 in FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. Although these losses did not have a material adverse impact on our Group’s financial performance during the Financial Years/Period Under Review, there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses that could materially and adversely impact our Group’s financial performance in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(viii) Inadequacy of insurance coverage may cause significant loss and damage to us** (p. 199)\n",
      "\n",
      "  We maintain insurance at levels that are customary in our industry to protect against various losses and liabilities, such as fire, burglary and personal accident insurance arising from our business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We also procure insurance for all of our ICT hardware that are leased or rented. This allows us to claim for risks relating to the ICT hardware including damage, stolen or lost ICT hardware, subject to the terms of the insurance policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "  During the Financial Years/Period Under Review, there were no insurance claims that have materially impacted our financial performance and position.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Notwithstanding, our financial performance may be adversely impacted if we incur substantial losses that are in excess of our insured sums or the losses incurred are not covered under our insurance policies. In addition, these insurance coverages are prone to exclusions and limitations of liability both in the amount and with respect to the insured events.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the event our losses exceed the insurance coverage or are not covered by our insurance policy, and we are unable to claim these losses from our customer and/or end-user, we may be required to bear such losses. Consequently, our financial performance and position may be adversely impacted. Further, the insurance coverage is subject to annual renewal, and there is no assurance that we will be able to renew or procure new insurance policies on favourable terms and at premiums acceptable to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(ix) We may face risks of security breaches** (p. 199)\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the course of providing cloud solutions and services, with the consent of our customers, we may have access to customers’ confidential information, including information on their ICT policies and ICT systems. In addition, we also subscribe to cloud solutions provided by our Principals and/or Principals’ Distributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As such, we may face risks of external security threats and internal security breaches which could result in a breach of customers’ confidential information or breach of these cloud solutions which we subscribe to. External security threats include malware attacks, hacking, espionage and cyber intrusion. Meanwhile, internal security breaches include unauthorised access to restricted information by employees or attacks that originate from malware-infected devices that are brought into the network system by employees. Any such security attacks and breaches can compromise the security of our ICT infrastructure and data.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since our commencement of business till the LPD, there have been no incidents of security attacks and breaches that have materially and adversely affected our business operations. However, despite this, there is no guarantee that our internal ICT infrastructure and data will not be subject to inadvertent conduct (which may arise from software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee error or misconduct, amongst others), unauthorised disclosure or loss of personal or confidential information, or security breaches by third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, we implement cloud solutions and services, which involve implementing IaaS and PaaS based on private, public or hybrid cloud deployment models. Although our cloud solutions and services are sourced from Principals and Principal’s Distributors, and our scope of work is limited to the implementation of these cloud solutions and services and does not encompass the design of our customers’ security infrastructure, we could be perceived to be responsible should there be any security breaches to the cloud infrastructure implemented for customers. (p. 199)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Any data leakage or loss of data or cybersecurity breaches to our customers’ data and ICT infrastructures or as a result of the provision of our services, or breaches to our Principal’s and/or Principals’ solutions, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect the market perception of our services. This, in turn, may damage our Group’s reputation. If any such incident relating to the leakage or loss of confidential information of our customers is by us, this could expose us to significant liability if we are subject to litigation or other action resulting in monetary damages and legal fees. (p. 200)\n",
      "\n",
      "  As a result, we may incur additional costs in defending any claims, and this could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For the Financial Years/Period Under Review and up to the LPD, there have not been any claims made against us in respect of security breaches. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to any security breaches in the future, which may adversely affect our reputation and financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In particular, Rhipe Malaysia Sdn Bhd (“Rhipe”) who is an authorised distributor of Microsoft products to whom we have paid a subscription fee for the use of the Microsoft Azure solution, had notified our Group of high consumption of the said solution in November 2022 though we have ceased subscribing to the solution post-October 2022. The high consumption of the solution was likely due to a breach of security. Although our Group was not responsible for the use of the said solution, we had received a letter of demand from Rhipe for the payment of an alleged sum of RM2.17 million being the outstanding sum due and payable for providing Microsoft Azure cloud services to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We have since responded to the letter of demand on 15 September 2023 stating we have no knowledge of the allegations therein and denying these claims by Rhipe. We have also issued a letter to request for discovery against Rhipe seeking clarification on pertinent matters relating to their claim. As at the LPD, we have not received any additional letter of demand or court summons from Rhipe or its solicitors to claim for the alleged outstanding sums due and payable for the Services, nor have we received any response to our respective letters to Rhipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Should the case continue, we may be liable to pay for charges of use of the Services up to 5 December 2022, when Rhipe ought to have suspended the subscription of the solution. As our Group is unable to obtain the breakdown for the utilisation up to 5 December 2022, our Group is unable to quantify the charges of use of the Services up to 5 December 2022. However, should we be liable to pay for these charges, we may incur a cost of up to RM2.17 million, which may impact our financial performance. Our financial performance could also be adversely impacted if we have to incur additional costs in defending any claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 9.2 Risks Relating to Our Industry (p. 201)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(i) We face competition in our industry** (p. 201)\n",
      "\n",
      "  We face competition from ICT Solution providers in Malaysia and potential new entrants in the industry. Increased competition has, and will continue to have, an impact on our ability to retain our existing customers and secure new customers, and this may adversely affect our Group’s operational results and financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our Group generally offers similar products as our competitors, i.e. ICT hardware and software on a lease or rental basis. We generally compete with other competitors in terms of our ability to offer a range of ICT Solution brands and timeliness of delivery. Our competitiveness is also dependent on our ability to maintain our service level and uphold our reputation in the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, we may also compete with existing and new entrants who adopt aggressive pricing strategies and offer more attractive sales terms, which may result in stiffer competition and a reduction of our market share in the ICT Solution industry. If we are unable to remain competitive and adapt to industry changes, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(ii) We are exposed to the risk of supply disruption of ICT hardware resulting from global shortages of semiconductors** (p. 201)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Semiconductors are an integral part of the manufacturing of ICT hardware, which is also an important part of implementing our ICT Solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a global shortage of semiconductors, as fabrication activities were disrupted when foundries could not operate due to national lockdowns and the imposition of tariff barriers restricting companies in the United States of America (“United States”) and the People’s Republic of China (“China”) from trading. The higher demand for electronic products further exacerbated the shortage of semiconductors globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, the Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, also exacerbated the shortage of microchips globally. Both Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of palladium and neon, which are raw materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. While foundries have stocked up on these materials, a prolonged war affected the supply of semiconductors globally, which consequently had an adverse impact on the manufacturing of ICT hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The on-going trade sanctions between the United States and China resulted in the United States imposing export controls on certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment to companies based in China. This has hindered companies in China from producing advanced semiconductor products, thus affecting the availability of semiconductors worldwide. Further, the imposition of tariffs on semiconductor products and raw materials between the United States and China has increased the cost of importing and exporting semiconductor products, causing prices of consumer products, such as ICT hardware to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "  While our Group has experienced delays in receiving supplies of ICT hardware in the past, we have not experienced any material adverse impact on our financial performance due to such disruptions in supplies of ICT hardware. However, there can be no assurance that any future disruption in the supply of ICT hardware will not have a negative impact on our Group’s financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(iii) We are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks** (p. 202)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our business is subject to the risks associated with conducting business in Malaysia because we mainly sell our ICT Solutions to customers within Malaysia and purchase ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud subscriptions from local suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Notwithstanding that we principally operate in Malaysia, we derive a portion, albeit a small percentage of our revenue, from other countries. For the Financial Years/Period Under Review, our revenue generated from international markets accounted for approximately 0.06%, 0.07%, 0.03% and 1.13%, respectively. We may also obtain cloud subscriptions directly from Principals, who are based in international markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We are thus susceptible to legal, regulatory, political and economic conditions as well as operational risks in Malaysia and other countries. As we continue to expand our business, our financial performance and position could be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "  (a) political and economic instability, including global and regional macroeconomic disruptions such as natural calamities, epidemics or other risks related to countries where we procure our ICT hardware, ICT software and cloud subscriptions, or sell our ICT Solutions;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (b) unfavourable changes in government policies such as the introduction of new regulations, including trade protection measures, sanctions, import or export restrictions and licencing regulations, duties, tariffs or subsidies; and\n",
      "\n",
      "  (c) risks related to social and political crises resulting from riots, terrorism, war or civil unrest, amongst others.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There can be no assurance that any adverse legal, regulatory, political or economic conditions will not materially affect our Group’s future financial performance.\n",

      "- **(i) No prior market for our Shares on the ACE Market and it is uncertain whether a sustainable market for our Shares on the ACE Market will ever develop** (p. 203)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Before our Transfer of Listing and IPO, there has been no prior market for our Shares on the ACE Market. Hence, there is no assurance that upon Listing, an active market for our Shares will develop, or if developed, that such a market will be sustainable. There is also no assurance as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for our Shares, the ability of holders to sell our Shares or the selling prices at which holders would be able to sell our Shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We and our Promoters have no obligation to make our Shares marketable. The IPO Price was determined after taking into consideration various factors, and these factors could cause our Share price to fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our Shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There can be no assurance that the IPO Price will correspond to the price at which our Shares will trade on the ACE Market upon our Listing and that the market price of our Shares will not decline below the IPO Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(ii) Capital market risks and share price volatility** (p. 203)\n",
      "\n",
      "  The performance of the capital market is very much dependent on external factors such as the performance of the regional and global stock markets and the inflow or outflow of foreign funds. Sentiment is also largely driven by internal factors such as the economic and political conditions of the country as well as the growth potential of the various sectors of the economy. These factors invariably contribute to the volatility of trading volumes in the capital market, thus adding risks to the market price of our listed Shares. Nevertheless, the profitability of our Group is not dependent on the performance of the capital market, as the business activities of our Group have no direct correlation with the performance of securities listed in the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our Shares could trade at prices lower than the IPO Price depending on various factors, including current economic, financial and fiscal conditions in Malaysia, our operations and financial results and the price volatility in the markets for securities in similar or related industries in Malaysia or emerging markets. There is no assurance that any market for our Shares will not be disrupted by price volatility or other factors, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In addition, the market price of our Shares may be highly volatile. It could fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, amongst others, the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n",
      "\n",
      "  (a) variation in our results and operations;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (b) success or failure of our management team in implementing business and growth strategies;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (c) changes in securities analysts’ recommendations, perceptions or estimates of our financial performance;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (d) changes in conditions affecting the industry, the general economic conditions or stock market sentiments or other events and factors;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (e) additions or departures of our Key Senior Management team;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (f) fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; or (p. 203)\n",
      "\n",
      "  (g) involvement in litigation. (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  In addition, many of the risks described herein could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Shares. Furthermore, if the trading volume of our Shares is low, price fluctuation may be exacerbated. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our Shares will not trade lower than the IPO Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(iii) Our Promoters will be able to exert significant influence over our Company as they will continue to hold a majority of our Shares after the IPO** (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  As disclosed in Section 5.1.1 of this Prospectus, our Promoters will collectively hold in aggregate 51.85% of our enlarged issued share capital after our Listing. As a result, they will be able to, in the foreseeable future, effectively control the business direction and management of our Group as well as have voting control over our Group and, as such, will likely influence the outcome of certain matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, unless they are required to abstain from voting either by law and/or by the relevant guidelines or regulations. There can be no assurance that the interests of our Promoters will be aligned with those of our other shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(iv) The sale or the possible sale of a substantial number of Shares in the public market following our IPO could adversely affect the price of our Shares** (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Following the completion of our IPO and Listing, approximately 37.88% of our enlarged issued share capital will be publicly held by investors participating in our IPO, while approximately 51.85% of our enlarged issued share capital, will be held by our Promoters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our Promoters may dispose of some or all of their Shares after their respective moratorium period, pursuant to their investment objectives. If our Promoters and substantial shareholders sell or are perceived as intending to sell a substantial amount of our Shares, the market price of our Shares could be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(v) Delay in or cancellation of our Listing** (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  The occurrence of certain events, including the following, may cause a delay in or termination of our Listing:\n",
      "\n",
      "  (a) our Joint Underwriters exercising their rights pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to discharge themselves from their obligations under such agreement;\n",
      "\n",
      "  (b) our inability to meet the minimum public spread requirement under the ACE LR of having at least 25.00% of the total number of our Shares for which our Listing is sought being in the hands of at least 200 public shareholders holding at least 100 Shares each at the point of our Listing; or\n",
      "\n",
      "  (c) the revocation of the approvals from the relevant authorities for our Listing for whatever reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Where before the issuance and allotment of our IPO Shares: (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  (a) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245(1) of the CMSA, the applications shall be deemed to be withdrawn and cancelled, and our Company shall repay all monies paid in respect of the applications for our IPO Shares within 14 days of the stop order, failing which we shall be liable to return such monies with interest at the rate of 10.00% per annum or such other rate as may be specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(a) of the CMSA; or (p. 204)\n",
      "\n",
      "  (b) our Listing is aborted, investors will not receive any of our IPO Shares, and all monies paid in respect to all applications for our IPO Shares will be refunded free of interest within 14 days. (p. 205)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Where subsequent to the issuance and allotment of our IPO Shares: (p. 205)\n",
      "\n",
      "  (a) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245(1) of the CMSA, any issue of our IPO Shares shall be deemed to be void, and all monies received from the applicants shall be forthwith repaid, and if any such money is not repaid within 14 days of the date of service of the stop order, we shall be liable to return such monies with interest at the rate of 10.00% per annum or such other rate as may be specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(b) of the CMSA; or\n",
      "\n",
      "  (b) our Listing is aborted other than pursuant to a stop order by the SC under Section 245(1) of the CMSA, a return of monies to our shareholders could only be achieved by way of cancellation of share capital as provided under the Act and its related rules to the extent that our IPO Shares form part of our share capital. Such cancellation can be implemented by the sanction of our shareholders by special resolution in a general meeting and supported by either (aa) consent by our creditors (unless dispensation with such consent has been granted by the High Court of Malaya) and the confirmation of the High Court of Malaya, in which case there can be no assurance that such monies can be returned within a short period of time or at all under such circumstances, or (bb) a solvency statement from the directors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(vi) Payment of dividends** (p. 205)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders will depend on, amongst others, our future financial performance, distributable reserves and cash flows. This, in turn, is dependent on our operating results, capital requirements and our ability to implement our future plans, demand for and selling prices of our products, general economic conditions, and other factors specific to our industry, many of which are beyond our control. As such, there is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends to our shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "  We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, dividends and other distributions received from our subsidiaries are our principal source of income. The receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries may also be affected by the passage of new laws, adoption of new regulations and other events outside our control, and our subsidiaries may not continue to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements for the payment of dividends in the future. In addition, changes in accounting standards may also affect the ability of our subsidiaries and, consequently, our ability to pay dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, our payment of dividends may adversely affect our ability to fund unexpected capital expenditure as well as our ability to make interest and principal repayments on any borrowings that we may have outstanding at the time. As a result, we may be required to borrow additional money or raise capital by issuing equity securities, which may not be on favourable terms or available at all. Further, if we incur new borrowings subsequent to our Listing, we may be subject to additional covenants restricting our ability to pay dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Our Board intends to recommend and distribute a dividend of up to 20.00% of the annual audited profit attributable to the owners of our Company after our Listing. However, dividend payments will depend on our ability to pay dividends and could not be guaranteed, and our Board may decide, at its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason, not to pay dividends. If we do not pay dividends or pay dividends at levels lower than that anticipated by investors, the market price of our Shares may be negatively affected, and the value of any investment in our Shares may be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further details of our dividend policy are set out in Section 12.13 of this Prospectus.\n",

      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",

      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",

      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",

      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",

      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",

      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",

      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",

Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "(i) Financial and operating history\n",
      "Based on our Group’s audited consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the FYE 2024, we recorded:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) an EPS of 1.11 sen, computed based on our Group’s audited FYE 2024 PAT attributable to owners of our Company of RM7.34 million and the total issued share capital of 662,453,200 Shares as at the LPD. This translates to a P/E Multiple of 18.02 times at our IPO price;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) an EPS of 0.92 sen, computed based on our Group’s audited FYE 2024 PAT attributable to owners of our Company of RM7.34 million and the total enlarged issued share capital of 795,453,200 Shares (assuming Public Issue of 133,000,000 Issue Shares pursuant to our IPO). This translates to a P/E Multiple of 21.74 times at our IPO price; and\n",

This translates to an EV/EBITDA Multiple of 4.58 times. For your information, our Group’s EV/EBITDA multiple before and after our IPO remains the same as the EV is computed based on market capitalisation adjusted for cash (including the proceeds to be raised from the Public Issue), borrowings and non-controlling interests.\n",

Malacca Securities and SCS Global have selected the comparable companies (“Comparable Companies”) listed on the Bursa Securities where the majority of its businesses (more than 50.00% of its revenue) are involved in the provision of ICT equipment and solutions.\n",

Any comparison made with respect to the Comparable Companies is merely to provide a comparison to the illustrative P/E Multiple and EV/EBITDA Multiple represented by our IPO Price. The selection of Comparable Companies is highly subjective and judgemental and the selected Comparable Companies may not be entirely comparable due to various factors.\n",

In addition, we are required to place a principal amount of up to 2 months of instalment with the financial institutions to obtain the debt financing facilities. For avoidance of doubt, the gross proceeds allocated for finance costs are not for our Group’s existing bank borrowings and interest payment, and thus will not result in any savings in interest expenses for our Group.\n",

Such insurance coverage covers loss of or damage to the ICT hardware leased or rented out as a result of events, amongst others, fire, theft or any accidental damage during the period of the insurance. The insurance coverage on ICT hardware serves to mitigate potential business operation risks and losses that result from the loss or damage of the insured ICT hardware and safeguard the value of the insured ICT hardware in case of loss or damage. It is also often required by the financial institutions as a condition of the debt financing agreement.\n",

      "\n",
      "Table: [no title] (p. 45-51)\n",
      "- Section: Section 4.13 (i); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: We intend to expand our revenue stream from device management software and computer security software. We recognise the growing need for corporations and associations to monitor the usage and status of ICT hardware and software as well as ICT maintenance and technical support services (“ICT Solutions”) to effectively manage their assets and avoid any potential operational disruptions. We also acknowledge the need for customers’ assurance of permanent data removal from ICT hardware after the rental period is completed or the device is disposed. We believe these products, which will be procured from third party providers, will add value to our existing ICT Solutions as they enable us to offer our customers the ability to better manage and monitor the ICT Solutions rented, leased or procured from us. As an illustration, device management software can identify any potential technical issues with an ICT hardware and alert users to make the necessary ICT hardware replacement if required. Meanwhile, the computer security software will assist us to provide our customers with added assurance of permanent data removal of all ICT Solutions through a certified and secured data removal process before its usage in a company is terminated as compared to the current process of reformatting all ICT hardware after the expiry of the rental/leasing period. As such, we have been creating awareness of the benefits of device management software and computer security software to our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to gauge the market acceptance of these products. Moving forward, we intend to grow our revenue stream from these products by actively marketing to both our existing and potential end-user customers. In particular, we will be marketing these products to private corporations such as Small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) and large corporations. We also intend to undertake online advertising and set up a dedicated website to promote these products. Further, we plan to organise events and participate in events to create awareness of these products. The cost for these marketing activities over the span of 1 year is expected to be approximately RM50,000, which will be funded via internally generated funds.; Current Status or Progress: Since our listing on the LEAP Market, our Group has begun offering device management and computer security software to enhance the value of our Group’s technology financing solutions business. In particular, our Group has begun offering the following value-added services by sourcing device management and computer security software from third-party ICT Solutions providers since 2021: (i) proactive and analytics service to monitor and predict device health in term of: (a) inventory and asset management, which allows for monitoring of devices where details (such as utilisation and warranty) for all devices are illustrated on a single dashboard; (b) device proactive incident management, which predicts and prevents technical issues concerning the devices by monitoring the condition of the devices. This allows for planning and prompt resolution(s) of technical issues; (c) device performance and health analytical management, which analyses device performance with proactive insights and reports to anticipate the needs of service or maintenance and easy device management; and (d) device security and user management, which manage users with attached devices and monitor device usage by user(s); and (ii) permanent data removal service, which produces an auditable and digitally signed certificate as proof that customers’ device’s data has been 100% erased after the leasing/rental period or when the ICT hardware is disposed of. From FYE 2022 to FYE 2024, our Group utilised RM51,000 to undertake initiatives such as campaigns or content marketing with Microsoft and Principals (RM25,000), as well as webinars and events hosted by media to promote the abovementioned value-added services (RM26,000). As such, the budgeted expenses for such marketing activities had been fully utilised. In 2021, our Group launched Device-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) 360 in a subscription model, which comprises life cycle management and device recovery services with financial solutions. DaaS 360 enables enterprises to optimise the usage of ICT hardware and supports as well as repurpose and reuse old ICT hardware, thereby reducing the number of ICT hardware wasted after their life cycle ends. The DaaS 360 has been certified with the MyHIJAU mark, a green recognition scheme endorsed by the Government. Our Group’s efforts in marketing the abovementioned services have been concentrated on creating awareness among our Group’s Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to gauge market acceptance. The introduction of these software serves to enhance the value proposition of our Group’s products offerings, thereby increasing the demand for our Group’s products. Our Group has also been developing marketing strategies to further capitalise on this opportunity by way of, amongst others, online advertising via a dedicated website (i.e. https://daas.my/) which went live in June 2022, social media or social networking platforms (i.e. TikTok and LinkedIn), and participation in events (such as Microsoft 365 DaaS Seminar 2022, HP DaaS Seminar 2022, SME Growth Summit 2023 and Top in Tech Talk Series Webinar 2023) and/or tenders (or presentation, as the case may be) to corporations and Government associations via our Group’s Channel Partners and/or Strategic Partners to promote these products to both existing and potential end-user customers, particularly within the private sector, including SMEs and large corporations. We propose to allocate part of the proceeds to be raised from the Public Issue to fund these marketing activities over the next few years.\n",
      "- Section: (ii); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: We intend to offer our new and existing customers a new option for financing ICT Solutions We presently offer our customers the option to rent, lease or purchase ICT Solutions. Moving forward, we intend to enable the purchase of ICT Solutions through factoring financing. Factoring financing refers to short-term financing offered by our Group to finance invoices relating to ICT Solutions purchases by our customers. Through our past experience in the ICT industry, we understand that our Channel Partners commonly face cash flow constraints when acquiring ICT Solutions for their onward sale to their customers. With factoring financing, we will be able to provide capital to our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners for the purchase of ICT Solutions. This would also benefit our trading segment as it will ease the outright purchase of ICT Solutions. We are currently finalising our arrangements with stakeholders such as financial institutions as well as our Channel Partners and Strategic Partners to facilitate this new business model. We plan to finalise the arrangements and launch this business model before the end of 2022.; Current Status or Progress: We have been constantly monitoring the evolving technology financing needs and have focused our efforts on bundling our technology financing solutions with other ICT products or offerings to meet our customers’ needs and demands. Correspondingly, our Group’s revenue increased from RM39.56 million for the FYE 2021 to RM114.43 million for the FYE 2024. Having observed significant growth in our Group’s revenue during this period, we have decided to remain focused on our core product offerings (i.e. bundling our technology financing solutions with other ICT products or offerings) and have yet to launch our business model of purchasing ICT Solutions through factoring financing. Nevertheless, we may revisit this plan again in the future should the need arise.\n",
      "- Section: (iii); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: We intend to grow sales on our e-commerce platform On 16 February 2020, we launched our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, and have generated sales of approximately RM0.4 million up to 26 October 2020. Subsequent to the launch, we have optimised our back-end operational activities in terms of payment gateway solutions and logistics to improve customer experience. We acknowledge e-commerce as an effective means to reach out to the mass market and we believe that we can leverage the potential of the e-commerce industry to expand our business. According to the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the e-commerce market in Malaysia has illustrated healthy growth. The e-commerce market size in Malaysia, as depicted by e-commerce transaction values in the country, increased from RM195.1 billion in 2015 to RM268.6 billion in 2019 at a CAGR of 8.3%. The e-commerce market is expected to continue to grow in light of growing broadband penetration, proliferation of mobile devices, increased acceptance of digital payments, change in consumer lifestyle trends, rising income levels over the long-term, improved logistics infrastructure and favourable government initiatives. As such, we intend to grow sales from our e-commerce platform by intensifying our marketing efforts to promote our e-commerce platform. To this end, we will be investing in online advertising activities to increase traffic to our e commerce platform. We also intend to expand our sales team to include 2 new personnel by the end of 2020, who will be responsible for growing sales from this e-commerce platform. The estimated cost for these online advertising activities over the span of 1 year are approximately RM50,000, which will be funded via internally generated funds. Our e-commerce platform will allow us to capitalise on refurbished ICT hardware after expiry of the leasing and rental contracts. Further, our e-commerce platform will allow us to diversify our end-user customer base not just to include private corporations, government organisations and Channel Partners, but also retail consumers and third-party resellers.; Current Status or Progress: Since its launch, our Group’s e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, has contributed approximately RM3.28 million, RM2.45 million, RM2.99 million and RM1.04 million in revenue for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. The e-commerce platform enables us to capitalise on refurbished ICT hardware following the expiration of the leasing and rental contracts for the relevant ICT hardware. The e-commerce platform serves as a distribution channel to facilitate our Group’s disposal of refurbished ICT hardware (i.e. laptops, desktops, monitors, printers and projectors), thereby enhancing our Group’s financial performance. Additionally, it allows us to diversify our end-user customer base beyond private corporations, government organisations, and Channel Partners to include retail consumers and third-party resellers. Following the launch, we had in 2021 commenced and completed the optimisation of the back-end operational and marketing activities. Such optimisation includes enablement of online payment gateway solutions and logistics for door-to-door delivery, both of which serves to enhance the overall customer experience. In addition, we have also undertaken, amongst others, the following initiatives efforts to promote the e-commerce platform: (i) our Group has been collaborating with logistic service providers since 2021 to deliver ICT hardware purchased by the customers. As at the LPD, we have engaged 18 logistics service providers; (ii) launched a new range of removable vinyl sticker products with visually appealing designs in 2023 to enable customers to enhance the appearance of ICT hardware purchased; (iii) enhancing the functionality of the e-commerce platform by including a limited warranty on the product, which covers ICT hardware defects and ICT software malfunctions. In addition, we have also inserted a parcel/shipment tracking webpage on the e-commerce platform since 2021; and (iv) creating awareness on social media platforms (i.e. Facebook and Instagram) or social networking platforms (i.e. TikTok and LinkedIn) as well as investing in search engine optimisation for the Google Ad Word Search Engine to direct traffic to the e commerce platform since 2020. In addition, we also engage in promotional materials such as bunting and flyers as well as an Light Emitting Diode (LED) advertisement on a skybridge. From the FYE 2021 to FYE 2024, we had incurred marketing expenses of approximately RM54,000 for the promotion of the Group’s e-commerce platform. As such, the budgeted expenses for such marketing activities had been fully utilised. As at the LPD, the Group has recruited 5 personnel as the sales team dedicated to growing sales from the e-commerce platform. For the period commencing 1 February 2024 and up to the LPD, the e commerce platform has attracted a total of 12,329 visitors.\n",
      "- Section: Section 4.1.4 Prospects (as disclosed by the Management of ICT Zone Asia); Disclosures in the Information Memorandum: Our Group intends to leverage on our existing customer base to expand our revenue stream from device management software and computer security software. Further, our Group also intends to capture future growth opportunities by offering corporations and organisations factoring financing of ICT Solutions. This will allow potential customers to finance their assets, namely ICT hardware, to purchase newer ICT Solutions. We believe this to be an attractive proposition to corporations and organisations seeking to reduce initial upfront investments on ICT Solutions. In addition, our Group also intends to grow our e-commerce platform, namely www.komputermurah.my, which would target retail consumers and third-party resellers. In light of the growing e-commerce market in Malaysia, as highlighted in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, we acknowledge e-commerce as an effective means to reach out to retail consumers and third-party resellers, to expand our business. The recent COVID-19 pandemic had led to the implementation of national lockdown policies in many countries, including Malaysia. In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (“MCO”), which was implemented in March, entailed the closure of all Government and private premises except those involved in essential services (water, electricity, energy, telecommunications, postal, transportation, irrigation, oil, gas, fuel, lubricants, broadcasting, finance, banking, health, pharmacy, fire, prison, port, airport, safety, defence, cleaning, retail and food supply). The subsequent transition to Conditional MCO in May and Recovery MCO in June provided some relief to corporations as they were allowed to operate, though at a limited capacity. Although Conditional MCO and Enhanced MCO are implemented in October in several states and territories including Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya, Penang and Sabah due to a resurgence in number of new COVID-19 cases, the corporations are still allowed to operate at a limited capacity and are subject to travel restrictions in the relevant areas. As mentioned in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the COVID-19 pandemic played a part in driving the Digital Economy. Many corporations have implemented work-from-home policies during the MCO, Conditional MCO, Recovery MCO and Enhanced MCO periods, which gave rise to the use of digital tools to enable file sharing, virtual video and audio teleconferencing as well as project management tools. Our Group benefitted from the accelerated shift towards the Digital Economy and is expected to continue benefiting as ICT Solutions become increasingly essential in carrying out daily operational tasks. Thus, in the short-term, we do not foresee any material adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance, liquidity position and business operations. Against this backdrop, we seek a listing on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities to facilitate our future growth and strengthen our position as an ICT Solutions provider in Malaysia.; Current Status or Progress: The Government has identified the ICT sector as a key driver of economic growth. The Government has taken steps to encourage the development of the ICT sector through initiatives such as the National Digital Network (Jendela) and the Digital Economy Blueprint. As developing countries struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, digital solutions enable economic transformation and put them on a path toward green, resilient, and inclusive growth. The Government has introduced Malaysia Digital as the new national strategic initiative to encourage and attract companies, talents and investment while enabling businesses and the population in Malaysia to play a leading part in the global digital revolution and digital economy. To achieve this, the Government on 19 February 2021 launched the Malaysian Digital Economy blueprint, where an investment of RM15.0 billion was allocated to aid the implementation of 5G nationwide over a period of 10 years and the Malaysia Digital Economy is expected to contribute 22.6% of Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) and create about 500,000 new jobs by the year 2025. With the new digitalisation targets rolled out, it is expected that the demand for ICT Solutions will increase in the near future following the Government’s efforts to achieve all the above targets. We are fully committed to playing our part in advancing the country’s digitalisation journey. For information purposes, our Group’s technology financing solutions businesses’ total unbilled order book for the next five years has increased to RM236.57 million as at the LPD from RM45.9 million as at 26 October 2020, being the latest practicable date before the date of the Information Memorandum issued on 6 November 2020. The substantial growth over the years highlights the increasing demand for the services and the confidence that our Group’s clients have in our ability to deliver customer-centric and sustainable solutions. The unbilled order books of RM236.57 million are expected to be progressively translated to revenue and profit over the next five financial years. In addition, our Group’s e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, has contributed approximately RM3.28 million, RM2.45 million, RM2.99 million and RM1.04 million in revenue for the FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and FPE 2024, respectively. We will continue with our Group’s strategic focus on our business model of providing technology financing solutions and creating an ecosystem around these solutions to add value to our Group’s technology financing solutions. Thus, the leasing and rental of ICT Solutions will remain our Group’s primary focus for the coming year. On top of that, we will continue to enhance our operating model and cost structure to explore new financing options (including factoring financing) for ICT Solutions for our new and existing customers, should the need arise.\n",

      "\n",
      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

This means that if your extraction involves translating a key into its representative value—for example, if the key is `CYT` and the value is `Choo Yan Tiee, the Promoter, Specified Shareholder, major shareholder, Executive Director and Managing Director of our Company`—then instead of extracting `CYT` as the entity name, you should extract `Choo Yan Tiee` as the entity name.\n",

      "### INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT solutions refer to a collection of ICT hardware, ICT software, ICT services, as well as cloud solutions and services. ICT solutions have become increasingly important as a growing number of corporations and Government agencies digitalise and automate their operations. These ICT solutions are essential for corporations and Government agencies to run their day-to-day business operations, as well as perform transactions with customers and suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT hardware (such as desktops, laptops, printers and projectors) and ICT software (such as application software and operating systems) can be either:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sold on an outright basis, where ICT hardware and/or ICT software are distributed or retailed to corporations, Government agencies and individual customers; or\n",
      "\n",
      "- Rented or leased, where ICT hardware and/or ICT software are rented or leased to corporations or Government agencies who will pay a monthly or annual fee for the continuous use of the ICT hardware and/or software.\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT services are services provided to support corporations and Government agencies in the management and maintenance of the ICT hardware and ICT software (such as technical support, device management, maintenance, consultancy and managed services). These ICT services can either be provided alongside the rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software, or provided as a standalone service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, cloud solutions refer to computing resources that are delivered through the Internet (such as storage, network and applications) and provided on a subscription or on-demand basis. There are 3 main types of cloud solutions and services, namely:\n",
      "\n",
      "- infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), where ICT infrastructure (such as storage and network infrastructure) are provided on a pay-as-you-use basis. This allows for data storage, data backup and disaster recovery;\n",
      "\n",
      "- platform-as-a-service (PaaS), where applications can be built, deployed and managed without the complexity of managing the underlying (or physical) ICT infrastructure; and\n",
      "\n",
      "- software-as-a-service (SaaS), where software are provided on a pay-as-you-use basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud services refer to the services involved in the implementation of these cloud solutions. These services include consultancy and management to propose suitable cloud solutions, cloud migration services to assist corporations and Government agencies to migrate their software applications and data from on-premises ICT infrastructure to cloud-based infrastructure, as well as implementation of cloud solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud solutions and services can be implemented based on the following deployment models:\n",
      "\n",
      "- private cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organisation, and will typically be managed internally and located on-premises;\n",
      "\n",
      "- public cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is shared by multiple organisations via the internet, which is typically offered by third-party providers; and\n",
      "\n",
      "- hybrid cloud, where the cloud infrastructure is a computing environment that combines both private cloud with public cloud.\n",

      "\n",
      "The performance of the ICT solution industry in Malaysia can be measured based on sales of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **ICT hardware and ICT software**\n",
      "The ICT hardware and ICT software industry size Malaysia grew, in terms of industry revenue, from RM26.4 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM37.4 billion in 2024, registering a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.1% during the period. The ICT hardware and ICT software industry in Malaysia is forecast to grow by a CAGR of 4.8% between 2025 and 2027, to reach RM43.0 billion in 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **ICT services**\n",
      "The ICT services industry size registered a CAGR of 6.3% during the same period, having grown from RM72.1 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM110.9 billion in 2024. ICT services industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2025 and 2027, to reach RM130.9 billion in 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cloud solutions and services**\n",
      "The cloud solutions and services industry in Malaysia, as indicated by the expenditure on public, private and hybrid cloud infrastructure, grew from RM2.8 billion in 2017 to an estimated RM10.8 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 21.3%.

      "### KEY DEMAND DRIVERS\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid pace of technological evolution and introduction of new trends, which would create a need for corporations and Government agencies to upgrade their ICT solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "The evolution of technology has led to continuous introductions and advancements in ICT hardware and ICT software. Such ICT hardware and ICT software are constantly being enhanced in terms of speed, features and memory space, amongst others. This has led to corporations and Government agencies constantly upgrading their ICT hardware and ICT software to keep up with the latest trends in order to improve work productivity and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, some of the recent trends in the ICT solution industry include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **The introduction of neural processing unit (“NPUs”)**\n",
      "Central processing units (“CPUs”) are currently commonly used as microprocessors, wherein CPUs act as the brains of computing devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets. CPUs are crucial in enabling computing devices to run operating systems and various applications. Over the years, more advanced versions of CPUs have constantly been introduced to allow for faster processing, increased efficiency as well as reduced power consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "NPUs are specialised ICT hardware components designed to handle artificial intelligence (“AI”)-related tasks efficiently. In recent times, NPUs have begun to be used as main processors in personal computers in replacement of CPUs. This will revolutionise personal computers as NPUs can accelerate operating systems to perform AI-related tasks while consuming less energy, thereby contributing to longer battery life, faster execution and enhanced user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, Microsoft Corporation’s latest operating system, Windows 11, is built with Copilot. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Microsoft Corporation’s operating systems are the most commonly used operating system in personal computers today, and the shift towards Windows 11 will eventually encourage the adoption of NPUs in personal computers. This shift would consequently result in corporations and government agencies upgrading their ICT hardware and software, which would create demand for ICT solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Growing demand for rental and lease-based ICT solutions**\n",
      "As technology advances rapidly, the cost to keep up with the rapid changes may not be cost effective. Thus, in recent years, there is a shift in trend towards rental or lease-based ICT solutions, instead of ownership-based ICT solutions. This can be seen from the growth in leasing and rental of ICT hardware. Globally, the ICT hardware leasing and rental market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.0% from approximately USD120.0 billion in 2023 to approximately USD170.0 billion in 2030.¹ The growth in rental and leasing of ICT hardware is due to the lower upfront cost that allows corporations and Government agencies to reduce high capital investments. With the lower upfront capital investments, corporations and Government agencies are able to divert their capital investments to other income-generating activities. In particular, the Government of Malaysia has also adopted leasing models for ICT solutions over the years through its e-procurement system.²\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Increased awareness and implementation of sustainable practices**\n",
      "Another trend is the increased awareness and implementation of sustainable practices in the ICT solution industry. The ICT hardware’s carbon footprint measures the greenhouse gas emissions throughout all phases of a product lifecycle, such as manufacturing, transportation, use and end of life processing. Examples of strategies to reduce carbon footprint include sourcing sustainable raw materials, designing computing devices with high energy efficiency, extending the lifespan of computing devices and responsible electronic waste management and purchasing carbon credits. Thus, “Green” ICT solutions are thus sought after as they enable corporations and Government agencies to achieve sustainability goals.\n",

      "**Government initiatives to encourage digitalisation, which would drive demand for ICT solutions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The digitalisation of the economy is known as the “Digital Economy”, which refers to the increasing adoption and utilisation of ICT solutions in carrying out day-to-day operational tasks in businesses across various economic sectors in order to improve efficiency and facilitate globalisation. The pervasive impact of the Digital Economy can be observed throughout various economic sectors including the banking sector (where cash-based transactions have shifted to online-based transactions), manufacturing sector (where manual operations can now be automated or remotely controlled) and retail sector (where stores are not limited to physical outlets but also e-commerce platforms). The Digital Economy is expected to expand in Malaysia and as such, ICT solutions will become increasingly essential in carrying out daily operational tasks. In Malaysia, the contribution of the Digital Economy to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown from 18.3% in 2017 to an estimated of 23.5% in 2023.³\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan 2019-2023 will provide a favourable environment for the digitalisation of corporations and Government agencies, as it aimed to provide higher quality broadband at lower prices and improve connectivity throughout the country. This will have a positive impact on digitalisation, as high-quality digital connectivity is crucial to create and share digital data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2021, the Government of Malaysia launched Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (“MyDIGITAL”), a national initiative which aims to transform Malaysia into a digitally-driven, high-income nation and a regional leader in digital economy. MyDIGITAL maps out the strategies which will be undertaken in 3 phases (2021-2022, 2023-2025 and 2026-2030) to achieve the targeted outcomes of MyDIGITAL. Among the key thrusts in MyDIGITAL pertaining to the ICT solution industry are:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) Drive digital transformation in the public sector – leveraging digital technologies, data and digital intelligence to accelerate transformation into a digital government, both for public administration as well as to improve public service delivery; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii) Build enabling digital infrastructure – providing access to extensive and high-quality digital infrastructure (such as broadband, data centres and cable landing stations) to better enable people, corporations and the Government of Malaysia to participate in the digital economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the Government of Malaysia announced MyGovCloud in May 2022, an upgrade of the Public Sector Data Centre into a hybrid cloud solution for use by all government agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, in February 2021, the Government of Malaysia announced conditional approvals to 4 cloud service providers, namely Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Telekom Malaysia, to build and manage hyperscale data centres and cloud services, thus improving digital infrastructure in the country. These cloud service providers are expected to invest between RM12.0 and RM15.0 billion over the next 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Budget 2024, the Government of Malaysia announced enhanced efforts to encourage micro, small, and medium enterprises (“MSMEs”) to boost business resiliency and competitiveness in adopting automation and digitalisation solutions. The allocations provided include RM100.0 million for digitalisation grants of up to RM5,000 for upgrading of sales, inventory and digital accounting systems, as well as RM900.0 million to encourage small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) to increase productivity levels through automation and digitalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Budget 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia is providing an RM3.8 billion SME loan fund to support entrepreneurs make the shift to digitalisation and automation. Further, RM50.0 million has been allocated towards the Digital Matching Grant for SMEs and Digital Grant for Vendors under Bank Simpanan Nasional to accelerate digital transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These government initiatives to drive the digital economy in Malaysia will lead to demand for ICT solutions, thus benefiting ICT solution providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The move towards digitalisation of corporations and Government agencies, leading to an increased need for ICT solutions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Digitalisation has played a major role in allowing corporations and Government agencies to continue operations while staying relevant in the current business environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures were imposed globally to prevent the spread of the disease. This forced corporations and Government agencies to adapt to the situation with work from home arrangements for their employees. In order to ensure continued business productivity, corporations and Government agencies had to make use of technologies which could facilitate online collaboration, such as file sharing, messaging platforms, video conferencing and project management tools. The use of such\n",

      "\n",
      "technologies creates digital data, which require supporting ICT solutions such as servers and data storage space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globalisation has created more opportunities for corporations and Government agencies as they are no longer restricted to operating within their own country. Everything from sourcing raw materials, production, marketing, distribution and support services can be sourced from other countries. Digitalisation has allowed corporations and Government agencies to lower their costs and gain larger market share as they are able to explore new opportunities in other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporations and Government agencies need to take advantage of digitalisation to maintain competitiveness and explore new opportunities in today’s evolving business environment. As more corporations and Government agencies make the move towards digitalisation, they will require supporting ICT solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Growing number of companies, which indicates an increase in demand for ICT solutions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia has seen a steady growth of newly registered companies at an average increase of 3.5% annually between 2017 and 2024. According to latest available data from the Companies Commission of Malaysia, total companies in Malaysia grew from 1.3 million in 2017 to 1.6 million in 2024. In 2022, 54,529 companies were dissolved in Malaysia, which translated to 3.8% of the number of registered companies in the year.⁴ This indicates that there is a low percentage of companies that are dissolved of companies that are registered in Malaysia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steady growth trend of companies in Malaysia is expected to continue in light of the nation’s developing economy over the long-term. The growing number of companies registered each year provides opportunities for greater demand for ICT solutions in Malaysia, either through subscriptions or purchases of new ICT solutions or upgrade their current ICT solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of reducing upfront investments for ICT solutions for corporations and Government agencies**\n",
      "\n",
      "The rental or lease of ICT solutions allows customers and end-user customers to shift from capital to operational expenditure, thereby helping their corporations or Government agencies to be more competitive through substantially lower capital investments. ICT solution rental and lease eliminate the need for heavy upfront capital investments as corporations and Government agencies are able to obtain new ICT solutions and add computing capabilities without incurring risky large capital expenditures but instead pay smaller monthly or annual fee. Thus, the increased affordability is consequently expected to drive demand for ICT solutions. With the lower upfront expenditure, corporations and Government agencies are able to divert the capital to other income-generating activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the rental and leasing business model is gaining popularity, especially amongst MSMEs and Government agencies, as this business model frees up their capital for other income-generating business activities. Furthermore, corporations and Government agencies may also benefit from the convenience of procuring other added services offered by the same ICT solution provider, typically at an extra cost, such as consultancy, comprehensive customer and/or technical support, up-to-date devices/components, insurance, maintenance and repair services. In addition, the rental and leasing services are also suitable for corporations and Government agencies that are taking part in temporary or short-term events such as exhibitions which only require the temporary use of ICT infrastructure for a short duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rising income levels which will lead to greater spending power for ICT hardware and ICT software amongst individual customers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia’s gross national income (GNI) per capita grew from RM41,647 in 2017 to RM54,894 in 2024. The increase in disposable income will lead to greater spending power, creating demand for ICT hardware and ICT software amongst individual customers. The disposable income of the population in Malaysia is expected to continue growing in the long-term, and this will support demand for ICT hardware and ICT software.\n",

      "The barriers to entry for companies to set up a business in the sale of ICT hardware and/or ICT software is moderately low as ICT hardware and ICT software can easily be sourced and the company may only be involved in the trading of ICT hardware and ICT software on a small-scale basis. However, in order to provide leasing and/or rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software, companies must have the financial resources or capability to secure financing to procure ICT hardware. Thus, the barriers to entry of companies involved in the leasing and/or rental of ICT hardware and/or ICT software is moderately high.

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

This means that if your extraction involves translating a key into its representative value—for example, if the key is `CYT` and the value is `Choo Yan Tiee, the Promoter, Specified Shareholder, major shareholder, Executive Director and Managing Director of our Company`—then instead of extracting `CYT` as the entity name, you should extract `Choo Yan Tiee` as the entity name.\n",

The insurance premiums charged align with what the insurance provider dictates and the commission received by Risco is paid by the insurance providers (i.e. not by our Group) at rates fixed by Bank Negara Malaysia depending on the type of policies. As such, the insurance brokerage service provided to our Group was on an arms’ length basis.\n",

Our Group will also seek such relevant shareholders’ approval where required. We will also make disclosures in our annual report of the aggregate value of any recurrent related party transactions to be entered into by us (where required) based on the nature of the transactions made, names of the related parties involved and their relationship with our Group.

      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",

      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",

      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",

Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      \n",

Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",

      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",

      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",

      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",

      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",

      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",

The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

Thus, various ICT hardware such as desktops, laptops, printers and projectors, ICT software such as operating systems and application software, and cloud subscriptions which are applications offered on a subscription basis, are essential in business operations. ICT services such as consultancy, maintenance, technical support and device management are also important in supporting the use of ICT hardware, software and cloud subscriptions. (p. 110)\n",

      "\n",
      "Typically, our business value chain and relationship between our Principals and Principals’ Distributors as well as Channel Partners and Strategic Partners and end-users are as depicted below: (p. 110)\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure: Business Value Chain (p. 110)\n",
      "The diagram illustrates the flow of ICT solutions. It starts with a Principal, who provides products to a Principal's Distributor and an Appointed Distributor. These distributors then supply ICT hardware, software, and cloud solutions to the ICT Zone Asia Group. The ICT Zone Asia Group, in turn, provides technology financing solutions, trading of ICT hardware and software, ICT services, and cloud solutions and services to its Channel and Strategic Partners, who then deliver these solutions to the End-users.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been appointed by Principals as Appointed Resellers, thus allowing us to lease, rent, sell or use their ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions. We typically procure ICT hardware and software from Principal(s) and Principals’ Distributors. The Principal(s) will set the pricing for their Distributor(s) to sell the ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions to appointed resellers such as our Group either on an outright basis or subscription basis. We can only purchase the ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscriptions from the Principal or Principal’s Distributor(s). Despite procuring products from the Principal’s Distributor(s), we may engage with the Principal(s) to negotiate better pricing arrangements, particularly for orders or contracts that are larger in sales volume or value. Once the pricing has been agreed upon, the Principals will then inform their Distributor(s) to sell the said ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscription at the pre-agreed pricing to us. (p. 110)\n",
      "\n",
      "As and when required, we may also rent ICT hardware from third-party service providers. This occurs when we have higher demand for short-term rentals of ICT hardware, and/or a limited number of ICT hardware available, and/or have requests for specific refurbished ICT hardware brands or types that we do not keep as inventory. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Group may also lease ICT hardware from leasing companies, and these ICT hardware are subsequently subleased to our customers. These leases are operating leases as our Group does not assume the ownership or substantial risks associated with ownership of these assets. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "We lease, rent or sell ICT Solutions to Channel Partners and end-users. We may also sign strategic partnership agreements with some Channel Partners (whom we named as “Strategic Partners”) for us to have the exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to their customers. Please refer to Section 7.13 of this Prospectus for further information on our sales channels. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "We also sell refurbished ICT hardware directly, through Channel Partners and Strategic Partners and via our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, to retail customers. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the above, we also use ICT hardware, ICT software and/or cloud subscription sourced from Principals and/or Principals’ Distributors in the provision of cloud solutions and services to Channel Partners and end-users. (p. 111)\n",

      "\n",
      "### 7.2.1 History (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of the ICT Zone Asia Group can be traced back to 2000, when our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang, and Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, DS Ng, incorporated ICT Zone Holding (then known as NTP World Marketing Sdn Bhd). At that time, ICT Zone Holding was involved in the trading of audio-visual equipment to private corporations. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT Zone was subsequently incorporated in 2001 by our Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, DS Ng and another shareholder, Hoo Geok Choong (who had ceased to be a shareholder of ICT Zone since 2015). ICT Zone remained dormant until 2003, when our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Lim Kok Kwang, and ICT Zone Holding became shareholders. ICT Zone commenced its business in the trading and short-term rental of ICT hardware and software to private and public corporations and retail customers in 2003. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2004, we began to secure sales from our Channel Partners for their onward sale or rental to end-users in the Government sector. We secured our first order from Starza, who was then a Channel Partner to the end-users in the Government sector in 2004. Since then, we began to focus on expanding our customer base of private and public corporations and Channel Partners, and ceased selling to retail customers. As volume from our trading of ICT hardware and software segment grew, we were recognised as an Appointed Reseller by one of our Principals from whom we obtain our supplies of ICT hardware, Hewlett-Packard (M) Sdn Bhd (whose business is presently under HP Inc.) in 2009. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuant to ICT Zone becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ICT Zone Holding in 2006, ICT Zone Holding ceased its business of trading of audio-visual equipment which was then transferred to ICT Zone. Thereafter, ICT Zone Holding became an investment holding company. (p. 111)\n",
      "\n",
      "Realising the opportunities in renting ICT Solutions, our Group began to venture into long-term rental of ICT Solutions when we introduced EzRental in 2010. In the same year, ICT Zone Ventures was incorporated with the intention to establish, manage and operate the Shariah-compliant interest scheme under Section 28 of the Interest Schemes Act 2016 and Interest Schemes Regulations 2017. Interest scheme involves the pooling of financial contribution from the public in exchange for an interest in a particular scheme. Such interest includes the usage of the facilities and services provided under the scheme or profit or returns, depending on the nature of the scheme. Such scheme is registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT Zone Ventures had launched its first interest scheme on 28 March 2011 (which was subsequently converted from a conventional interest scheme to Shariah-compliant scheme after a year from its launch) and second Shariah-compliant interest scheme on 21 October 2014. Such interest schemes provided our Group with the capital to finance and support our offering of long-term rental of ICT Solutions. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, we began to sign strategic partnership agreements with our Strategic Partners. This provides us with the exclusive rights to finance, supply and deliver ICT Solutions to end-users of our Strategic Partners within the Government sector. Starza and Juricco (then known as Belia Wawasan Holding Sdn Bhd) became our Strategic Partners in 2010, and Haynik (then known as Haynik Mobile Venture Sdn Bhd) became our Strategic Partner in 2011. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, we began to offer leasing of ICT hardware and software under the brand name, i-leasing, after we were registered with Bank Negara Malaysia to offer leasing and factoring services under Section 21(1) of the Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989. For information, pursuant to the repeal of the Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989 by the Financial Services Act 2013 in the same year, such registration is no longer required. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "As the volume of ICT hardware and software that we rented, leased and traded increased, we were appointed as Appointed Resellers by other Principals, including Microsoft Corporation in 2012, Dell Technologies Inc. in 2014 and Lenovo Group Limited in 2015. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with vPROT MSP Sdn Bhd, thus rendering them a Strategic Partner. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT Zone Asia was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 28 January 2019 as a public company under its present name as a special purpose vehicle to facilitate our listing on the LEAP Market. It commenced its business on 9 December 2019 upon completion of the acquisition of ICT Zone, ICT Zone Ventures and Techfin Capital. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our funds raised from the interest schemes also grew, providing us with capital to secure more rental and leasing orders and contracts over the years. Up to August 2020, ICT Zone Ventures had raised a total of RM37.4 million from both schemes. The interest schemes were redeemed, whereby RM18.9 million was converted to ordinary shares and ICPS while the balance of RM18.5 million was repaid. The interest schemes were subsequently terminated to facilitate ICT Zone Asia’s listing on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities. Our Company had on 6 November 2020 submitted a listing application to Bursa Securities in relation to admission of our Company to the Official List of Bursa Securities and the listing and quotation of entire issued share capital comprising 533,757,500 ordinary shares and 75,320,000 ICPS on the LEAP Market of Bursa Securities. For information, our Company officially listed on LEAP Market of Bursa Securities on 15 December 2020. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our listing on the LEAP Market, we began to extend the range of value-added services offered with the leasing and renting of ICT Solutions, thus allowing us to rename our leasing and renting solutions to technology financing solutions. (p. 112)\n",
      "\n",
      "We later launched DaaS 360, which is a full suite of value-added services (comprising proactive and analytical services for devices, managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services, data backup and device recovery services and security management) offered with our long-term ICT rental services in 2021. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "We later expanded our range of value-added services and began offering “green” ICT Solutions when we introduced CNCS in July 2024. CNCS involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent to corporations and Government agencies. In this regard, we participate in the Bursa Carbon Exchange to purchase carbon credits. Once the carbon credits are used to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we lease or rent, it is then registered and certified with Verra, a global independent non-profit organisation that develops and manages standards for sustainable development. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Group also expanded our range of ICT Solutions to include cloud solutions and services upon completing the Acquisition of Haas and Share Subscription in Haas on 22 November 2021 and 25 November 2021 respectively, which resulted in Haas becoming a 58.25% subsidiary of our Group. HaaS is principally engaged in cloud solutions and cloud consultancy services under the CLOUDIFY.ASIA brand. ICT Zone Asia acquired 255,000 ordinary shares in HaaS for a total cash consideration of RM204,000 from ICT Zone Holding and entered into a share subscription agreement with HaaS for the subscription of 345,000 new ordinary shares for a total cash consideration of RM276,000. The transactions were not subject to the approval of the shareholders of ICT Zone Asia. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, we also launched our e-commerce platform, www.komputermurah.my, thus expanding our customer base of retail customers in 2020. We were also appointed as Appointed Resellers by other Principals, including ASUStek Computer Inc. in 2022, Acer Inc. and Veeam Software Inc. in 2023, Fortinet, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2024. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the years, we have obtained various awards and recognitions. ICT Zone Ventures attained the ISO 14001:2015 certification in April 2023, marking a significant milestone in its commitment to environmental sustainability. The ISO 14001:2015 certification denotes that our Group has a comprehensive framework to enhance our environmental management system and integrate sustainability into our business practices. This includes offering ICT Solutions that are designed to be durable, recyclable, and reusable. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our DaaS 360 has also been certified with the MyHIJAU mark, a green recognition scheme endorsed by the MGTC since June 2023. The MyHIJAU mark certifies that our DaaS 360 service meets the MGTC standards and is now certified as a green service. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "On 3 November 2023, our company had completed the Private Placement following the issuance of 53,375,700 new Shares, which resulted in an enlarged 587,133,200 Shares. Please refer to Section 4.11 of this Prospectus for further details of the utilisation of proceeds pursuant to the Private Placement. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "On 12 November 2024, 70,000 ICPS were converted to 70,000 Shares and the remaining 75,250,000 ICPS had matured on 21 January 2025 and converted to 75,250,000 Shares on 22 January 2025. (p. 113)\n",
      "\n",
      "ICT Zone Ventures had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation Sdn Bhd (MDEC) on 25 March 2025 to collaborate on the Business Digitalisation Initiative. The Business Digitalisation Initiative is an initiative driven by the Government of Malaysia that aims to provide assistance to micro, small and medium enterprises to support the digitalisation of their businesses. This assistance includes providing access to financing (such as microfinancing and alternative funding options), advisory on adopting technologies, digital maturity assessments, and upskilling opportunities through workshops and online courses. Based on the memorandum of understanding, we will provide our ICT Solutions, including DaaS 360 and ICT services, and conduct technical training sessions for these solutions over a period of 2 years, or unless earlier terminated by either party. This will support the Business Digitalisation Initiative which aims to accelerate digital adoption by providing financial support, advisory and digital maturity assessment. (p. 113-114)\n",

      "  Technology financing solutions refer to a combination of technology solutions to provide ICT Solutions, and financing solutions to provide customers with access to these ICT Solutions over an agreed duration. These ICT Solutions include ICT hardware such as computers, laptops, printers, projectors and related peripheral devices, and ICT software such as operating systems, antivirus and other computer security software, and application software. Value-added ICT services to support the use of ICT hardware and software are typically offered alongside these technology financing solutions. (p. 117)\n",

      "  Traditionally, ICT distributors/resellers’ primary function is to distribute ICT Solutions outright but their involvement usually ends at the point of sale, while financial service providers strictly specialise in providing financial solutions to facilitate the purchase of ICT Solutions. In contrast, technology financing solutions refer to a combination of ICT Solutions and financing solutions to provide customers with access to ICT Solutions on a lease or rental basis, thereby spreading customers’ cost over time, whilst giving customers the peace of mind as such ICT Solutions include maintenance services.

They may also rent or lease these ICT Solutions from us based on their budget and needs, which will lower their upfront capital investment. Medium to large corporations and Government agencies typically have more than 500 employees. As such, the capital investment for ICT Solutions for all of its employees can amount to a large sum. For illustrative purposes, a company would have to invest at least RM1.50 million on ICT Solutions for 500 employees, assuming a budget of RM3,000 per employee. (p. 123)\n",

Initially, we secured funding through interest schemes, where our first interest scheme was launched in 2011 through ICT Zone Ventures. We subsequently began to secure financing from financial institutions as our corporate profile was built through our listing on the LEAP Market. Our ability to secure financing from financial institutions allows us to raise more capital, to take on more orders and contracts for technology financing solutions. (p. 125)\n",

Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency. (p. 126)\n",

While we were not allowed to operate in our offices in Malaysia at this time, it did not have any major material impact on our business operations as our employees worked remotely from home. All deliveries of ICT Solutions were handled by third-party delivery providers and our Group had the necessary approvals to commute should they need to carry out any ICT services at customers’ premises. (p. 150)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020 and 2021, we experienced delays in shipment of ICT hardware, which have resulted in delays of up to 6 months in delivering technology solutions, and cloud solutions and services to our customers. These delays were largely contributed by a shortage in components used by our Principals to manufacture the ICT hardware. The shortage in components was due to the global shortage in microchips as fabrication activities were disrupted when foundries could not operate due to the national lockdowns, and imposition of tariff barriers to restrict companies in both the United States and China from trading. Nevertheless, this did not materially impact our business operations as the supply disruption was industry-wide. (p. 150)\n",

These digital tools require the use of ICT Solutions. As such, we benefitted from the growth of the industry during the period. (p. 150)\n",

(p. 197)\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, the ICT services industry size in Malaysia is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2025 and 2027. This growth is expected to be driven by new technological evolutions and industry trends such as the emergence of NPUs and their usage in personal computers as well as increased awareness and focus on environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability practices. The industry is also expected to be driven by the growing digitalisation and adoption of cloud computing in the country, Government initiatives to drive digitalisation, benefits of technology financing solutions as it reduces upfront investments, and the growing number of companies in the country. (p. 197)\n",

      "As we are an ICT Solution provider that can provide new and existing customers with a diverse range of ICT hardware and software, we expect to benefit from the shift towards the use of NPUs in personal computers. As mentioned in the IMR report by PROVIDENCE, Microsoft Corporation’s latest operating system, Windows 11, is built with Copilot. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that has an AI-powered chat assistant function to answer questions, assist with research, provide summaries of articles, books or events, and can integrate with other Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams to enhance productivity and efficiency. As Microsoft Corporation’s operating systems are the most commonly used operating system in personal computers today, and the shift towards Windows 11 will eventually encourage the adoption of NPUs in personal computers. This shift would consequently result in corporations and Government agencies upgrading their ICT hardware and software, which would create demand for ICT Solutions. We have already secured our first technology financing solution contract for NPU-enabled personal computers in June 2024. (p. 198)\n",

Over the years, we have been extending the range of value-added services offered with our technology financing solution business from just managed services to provide maintenance and technical support services, to providing proactive and analytical services for devices, data backup and device recovery services, security management and CNCS. (p. 200)\n",

      "One of our value-added services, CNCS, has been recently introduced. Since March 2024, we have been conducting a pilot project for one of our existing customers whereby we have purchased carbon credits to retire the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the ICT hardware we have leased to them. We have thus far retired 477.943 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions with 481 carbon credits as at the LPD. We have since launched CNCS to all of our customers in July 2024. (p. 200)\n",

      "We intend to further extend the range of ICT services we offer by offering remote managed services. Remote managed services will benefit our customers in terms of being able to promptly and remotely rectify software issues and perform software upgrades and updates. As our operations personnel will be able to remotely carry out any rectifications, upgrades or updates, our customers need not wait for an appointment to be made for an on-site visit to their premises. We will provide an alternative service offering to customers of our existing maintenance and technical support services which is currently being provided at our customers’ premises. (p. 200)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, as we will be able to centralise the management of our customers’ ICT hardware through a single system, this will enable us to cater to more customers. It will also reduce our costs as our operations personnel will be able to handle more customers in a shorter time span and will minimise travelling expenses to our customers’ premises. (p. 200)\n",
      "\n",
      "As at the LPD, we have presently identified a suitable system to facilitate the remote management services. We are presently working with the system provider to configure and test the system to ensure that it meets our operational needs. The configuration and testing of the system commenced since July 2024. The annual cost to be incurred may vary depending on the number of users of the said system. (p. 200)\n",

      "You are a relationship-driven, non-taxonomic ontology construction agent. Your task is to extend the current ontology by extracting relevant entity and relationship types from the provided source text that align with and complement the specific purpose of the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - Given the ontology purpose, the current ontology, and a source text, extract entity and relationship types that fulfill the ontology’s purpose and complement the current ontology without duplication.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      - For each relationship found:\n",
      "         - If it supports the ontology purpose and is not semantically redundant:\n",
      "            - Model it as unidirectional (source → target).\n",
      "            - Extract missing entity types if they do not exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Extraction Constraints\n",
      "      1. Quality Requirements for Relationships\n",
      "         - Must contribute to the ontology purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Must be complementary, not redundant.\n",
      "            - Do not insert reversed relationships unless semantics differ.\n",
      "            - Example:\n",
      "               - employs vs worksFor → redundant → keep one.\n",
      "               - supplies vs purchasesFrom → complementary → both valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Definition requirements:\n",
      "            - Flexible enough to capture real-world variations.\n",
      "            - Not overly broad (e.g., isRelatedTo).\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each relationship:\n",
      "            - 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "            - 'source': Source entity type.\n",
      "            - 'target': Target entity type.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "            - 'examples': At least one straightforward, representative instance.\n",
      "         \n",
      "         - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      2. Quality Requirements for Entities\n",
      "         - Extract entities only if they are part of a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Entity's naming scope:\n",
      "            - Prefer the most general type that still supports the ontology purpose.\n",
      "            - Only specialize if narrower type adds unique analytical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "         - Attributes for each entity:\n",
      "            - 'entity_name': Noun phrase in camelCase (not too generic, not too specific).\n",
      "            - 'definition': Clear explanation of what this entity represents.\n",
      "            - 'llm-guidance': Must follow this structure:\n",
      "               - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",

      "\n",
      "      3. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "            \n",
      "      4. Insertion Task\n",
      "         - Only insert new entities and relationships.\n",
      "         - Do not update or delete existing ones.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   6. Output Format\n",
      "      - You are required to return ONLY the newly inserted entity or relationship types. You must not return entity or relationship types that already exist in the current ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - If no insertion is required, either because the source text does not provide additional value or does not align with the ontology’s purpose, return entities and relationships as an empty dict ({}) and provide an explanation in the note field. The note field shall not be used if something is returned; it should remain an empty string in this scenario.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

This means that if your extraction involves translating a key into its representative value—for example, if the key is `CYT` and the value is `Choo Yan Tiee, the Promoter, Specified Shareholder, major shareholder, Executive Director and Managing Director of our Company`—then instead of extracting `CYT` as the entity name, you should extract `Choo Yan Tiee` as the entity name.\n",

      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",

      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",

      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",

      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",

      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "You are an ontology enhancement agent tasked with improving the given ontology based on the provided feedback and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "Evaluation Result:\n",
      "Feedback 1:\n",
      "  Issue: The CompanyName entity is not linked via any relationship\n",
      "  Impact: Violates compactness; orphan entity that cannot be instantiated in the ontology\n",
      "  Suggestion: Either remove the CompanyName entity or introduce a unidirectional relationship (e.g., hasAlternativeName) linking Company to CompanyName\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 2:\n",
      "  Issue: Entity names 'revenueModel' and 'customerSegment' do not follow CamelCase convention\n",
      "  Impact: Inconsistent naming reduces clarity and may lead to annotation errors\n",
      "  Suggestion: Rename these entities to 'RevenueModel' and 'CustomerSegment', and update all corresponding relationships accordingly\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 3:\n",
      "  Issue: The direct reportsTo relationship duplicates the reified ReportingAssignment pattern\n",
      "  Impact: Inconsistent modeling of reporting relationships risks conflicting representations and hinders queries\n",
      "  Suggestion: Deprecate the reportsTo relationship and use only the ReportingAssignment reification (hasReportingAssignment, reportingAssignmentSubordinate, reportingAssignmentManager) or vice versa to maintain a single modeling approach\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 4:\n",
      "  Issue: ShareAllotment overlaps semantically with CorporateAction (both model share issuance events)\n",
      "  Impact: Redundant entity types create confusion and fragmentation in modeling corporate actions\n",
      "  Suggestion: Unify ShareAllotment under the CorporateAction entity (e.g., include share allotment as a type of CorporateAction) and remove the separate ShareAllotment entity to streamline event modeling\n",

      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",
      "   \n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "You are an ontology enhancement agent tasked with improving the given ontology based on the provided feedback and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "Evaluation Result:\n",
      "Feedback 1:\n",
      "  Issue: Entity 'OnlinePlatform' is not linked by any relationship\n",
      "  Impact: The orphaned entity cannot be instantiated or used in annotations, reducing ontology completeness and utility.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Introduce a relationship (e.g., hasOnlinePlatform) from Company to OnlinePlatform or remove the 'OnlinePlatform' entity if it is not required.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 2:\n",
      "  Issue: Redundant inverse relationships for OfferForSale ('undertakesOfferForSale' vs 'offerForSaleByCompany' and 'offerForSaleByPerson')\n",
      "  Impact: Violates the unidirectional design principle and adds unnecessary duplication, causing potential confusion during annotation.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Remove 'offerForSaleByCompany' and 'offerForSaleByPerson' and rely solely on 'undertakesOfferForSale'; if person-level sale needs modeling, introduce a dedicated Company→OfferForSale→Person path within the same unidirectional framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback 3:\n",
      "  Issue: Redundant inverse relationship 'contractWithCompany' duplicates 'entersIntoContract'\n",
      "  Impact: Creates bidirectional duplication, violating ontology compactness and unidirectionality.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Remove 'contractWithCompany' and use only 'entersIntoContract' to link Company to Contract; if counterparty annotation is needed, consider a separate relationship from Contract to NonListedOrganization without duplicating the company side.\n",

      "\n",
      "Feedback 4:\n",
      "  Issue: Potential overlap between 'CloudSolutionType' and 'ServiceOffering'\n",
      "  Impact: Annotators may be unclear whether to model cloud services as ServiceOffering or CloudSolutionType, reducing consistency.\n",
      "  Suggestion: Clarify the distinction by refining definitions (e.g., treat CloudSolutionType as a classification attribute of ServiceOffering) or merge CloudSolutionType into ServiceOffering to eliminate redundancy.\n",

      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",

      "               \n",

      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",

      "You are an ontology enhancement agent tasked with improving the given ontology based on the provided feedback and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "You are an ontology evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the given ontology according to the criteria defined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines:\n",
      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",

      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",

Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",

      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",

      "   1. Enhancement Principles\n",
      "      - You must enhance the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Enhancement (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Enhancement (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "   \n",
      "   2. Feedback as Reference\n",
      "      - You are given evaluation feedback on the ontology.\n",
      "      - Each feedback contains\n",
      "         1. 'issue': The problem.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Its consequence.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': A possible fix.\n",
      "         \n",
      "      - Rules for interpretation: Each feedback item must be addressed. The suggestions provided are for guidance only; you are not required to follow them if another solution better aligns with the enhancement principles and constraints.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   3. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You may perform structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also refine the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not introduce new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not encode role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to enhance the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - The required output fields are defined as follows:\n",
      "         1. 'updated_ontology': Output the complete updated ontology. If no modifications are made, output the original ontology unchanged.\n",
      "         2. 'modifications': List the modifications made along with the reasons for each change. If no modifications are required because the ontology is sufficiently robust (both high-level and low-level), leave this field as an empty array ([]).\n",
      "         3.  'note': Provide an explanation only when no modifications are required. The 'note' field remains an empty string if modifications are required.\n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",

      "Evaluation Result:\n",
      "Feedback 1:\n",
      "  Issue: Overlap between 'Product' and 'Offering' entities\n",
      "  Impact: Confusion about when to use each entity and potential inconsistent annotation\n",
      "  Suggestion: Merge 'Product' and 'Offering' into a single entity (e.g., 'Offering') with a property or classification to distinguish tangible vs intangible, or clarify the definitions to disambiguate their scopes.\n",

      "Feedback 2:\n",
      "  Issue: Missing holder relationship for 'EquityInterest'\n",
      "  Impact: Cannot represent equity interests held by persons or non-listed organizations, limiting modeling of shareholdings\n",
      "  Suggestion: Introduce relationships to link 'EquityInterest' to its holder, such as 'personHoldsEquityInterest' (Person->EquityInterest) and 'organizationHoldsEquityInterest' (NonListedOrganization->EquityInterest).\n",

      "  Issue: No relationship linking 'Contract' to its counterparty\n",
      "  Impact: Contracts cannot be associated with the other party (person or organization), losing critical context\n",
      "  Suggestion: Add relationships like 'contractHasCounterpartyPerson' (Contract->Person) and 'contractHasCounterpartyOrganization' (Contract->NonListedOrganization) to capture contract counterparties.\n",

      "   1. Evaluation Principles\n",
      "      - You must evaluate the given ontology from two perspectives:\n",
      "         1. High-Level Evaluation (ontology as a whole)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Purpose-oriented: Every entity and relationship must support the ontology’s stated purpose.\n",
      "               2. Compact: No redundant or overlapping entity/relationship types. Avoid bidirectional duplication. Ensure each entity type is connected to at least one relationship. Remove any entity not connected to a relationship.\n",
      "               3. Robust: Flexible enough to capture real-world variations relevant to the purpose.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Do we really need this entity/relationship type, or can its meaning be represented using an existing one?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "         2. Low-Level Evaluation (attributes of entities and relationships)\n",
      "            - Goals (priority order):\n",
      "               1. Unambiguous: No fuzzy or overlapping definitions.\n",
      "               2. General: Definitions broad enough for reuse, but not so broad they lose meaning.\n",
      "                     \n",
      "            - For entities, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'entity_name': CamelCase, specific but not overly narrow.\n",
      "               2. 'definition': Clear explanation of what the entity represents.\n",
      "               3. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "                  - Format: [rules for valid instances]\n",
      "               4. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "               \n",
      "            - For relationships, ensure:\n",
      "               1. 'relationship_name': Verb phrase in camelCase (e.g., hasSupplier).\n",
      "               2. 'source': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               3. 'target': Must be a valid entity type in the ontology.\n",
      "               4. 'llm-guidance': Structured as:\n",
      "                  - When to use: [specific conditions]\n",
      "               5. 'examples': At least one clear, representative instance.\n",
      "            \n",
      "               - Note that each source and target entity should contain only one entity. If a relationship can apply to multiple entity types—either source or target—create a new relationship for it. Do not attempt to assign two entity types to a single entity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "            - Focus question: “Would two different annotators using this ontology interpret this entity/relationship in the same way?”\n",
      "         \n",
      "   2. Constraints\n",
      "      1. Ontology Design Principles (priority order)\n",
      "         1. Purpose-oriented: Must support the ontology’s purpose.\n",
      "         2. Compact: No redundant or bloated entities/relationships.\n",
      "         3. Relationship-driven: Dynamics matter more than hierarchy.\n",
      "         4. Unidirectional: Avoid bidirectional duplication.\n",
      "         5. Non-taxonomic: Do not model taxonomies.\n",
      "\n",
      "      2. No Attribute Additions\n",
      "         - You are allowed to suggest performing structural changes (adding or removing entity or relationship types) to the existing ontology. You may also suggest refining the content of existing attributes (definition, llm-guidance, examples, and etc), but you must not suggest introducing new attribute fields beyond the defined schema.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      3. No Label Encoding\n",
      "         - You must not suggest encoding role, status, or other distinctions directly into instance labels (e.g., “Jane Doe (Independent Director)”). Labels must remain clean and canonical.\n",
      "         - If distinctions are needed, they must be represented structurally (e.g., by introducing a new relationship type).\n",
      "         - If the distinction is not essential for ontology construction, it should be left to knowledge graph instantiation.\n",
      "         - Remember: your sole responsibility is to evaluate and refine the ontology itself, not the knowledge graph built from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Evaluation Report\n",
      "      - For each flagged issue, provide the following fields:\n",
      "         1. 'issue': Description of the issue.\n",
      "         2. 'impact': Consequence of the issue.\n",
      "         3. 'suggestion': Your recommendation to address the issue.\n",
      "         \n",
      "   4. Output Format\n",
      "      - Return only the following raw JSON structure — no explanations, comments, or code block formatting.\n",
      "      - Any double quotes inside strings must be escaped using a backslash (\").\n",
      "      - If you think the ontology is robust enough (both high-level and low-level), leave the 'evaluation_result' as an empty array ([]) and provide an explanation in the 'note' field. The 'note' field remains an empty string if changes are required.\n",

      "Ontology Purpose:\n",
      "The ontology aims to model the interrelationships and operational dynamics of companies listed on Malaysia’s Main and ACE Markets. Its primary objective is to capture and represent relational knowledge that enables inference of implicit insights from explicit data, supporting retail investors in conducting fundamental qualitative analysis.\n",
      "Specifically, the ontology will cover three core dimensions:\n",
      "1. Strategic Aspects – such as partnerships, supply chain dependencies, market positioning, and competitive relationships.\n",
      "2. Operational Aspects – including executive roles, board and committee structures, business segments, and core activities.\n",
      "The ontology is designed to power a knowledge graph where relationships between entities are prioritized, enabling multi-layered reasoning about company strategy and operations context to aid investment decision-making.\n",
