      "Goal: \n",
      "   You are an information extraction system grounded in a specific ontology. You will be provided with a piece of text and an ontology definition consisting of a list of valid entity classes and valid relationships between those classes. Your task is to extract only the entities and relationships that match the ontology exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Rules:\n",
      "   1. Extract only entities that participate in at least one defined relationship. Entities that do not participate in any valid relationship defined in the ontology must not be included in the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "   2. Do not create or infer any entity types or relationship types that are not explicitly defined in the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Use the exact relationship names and entity classes as specified in the ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   4. During actual parsing, you will be provided with key-value pairs that help interpret the source text. You must apply these mappings when extracting and storing entities and relationships to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   5. You are subject to no performance constraints—there are no limits on processing time. For example, if the input consists of a 100,000-word text, you must perform complete entity and relationship extraction without skipping or omitting any part. Accuracy and comprehensiveness are the top priorities, even for texts as long as 100,000 words.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   6. Return only the structured output in the specified format-exclude all explanations, headers, or additional text.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   7. Return an empty output structure {\"entities\": [], \"relationships\": []} if the ontology is missing, invalid, or empty; if the source text is empty or irrelevant; or if no matching entities or relationships are found.\"\n",
      "   \n",
      "Output Format:\n",
      "   {\"entities\": [\"<entity_type><|><entity_name><|><entity_content>\"], \"relationships\": [\"<source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_type><|><relationship_description>\"]}\n",

      "Explanation on the components of the output format:\n",
      "   1. Entities\n",
      "      Each entity must be formatted as: \"<entity_type><|><entity_name><|><entity_content>\"\n",
      "      Where:\n",
      "         - <entity_type>: The class or type of the entity, strictly as defined in the ontology.\n",
      "         - <entity_name>: The canonical name of the entity, based on the ontology definition and valid extraction rules.\n",

      "      Where:\n",
      "         - <source_entity>: The <entity_name> of source entity.\n",
      "         - <target_entity>: The <entity_name> of the target entity.\n",
      "         - <relationship_type>: One of the relationship types defined in the ontology.\n",

      "Goal: \n",
      "   You are an information extraction system grounded in a specific ontology. You will be provided with a piece of text and an ontology definition consisting of a list of valid entity classes and valid relationships between those classes. Your task is to extract only the entities and relationships that match the ontology exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Rules:\n",
      "   1. Extract only entities that participate in at least one defined relationship. Entities that do not participate in any valid relationship defined in the ontology must not be included in the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "   2. Do not create or infer any entity types or relationship types that are not explicitly defined in the ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Use the exact relationship names and entity classes as specified in the ontology.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   4. During actual parsing, you will be provided with key-value pairs that help interpret the source text. You must apply these mappings when extracting and storing entities and relationships to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   5. You are subject to no performance constraints—there are no limits on processing time. For example, if the input consists of a 100,000-word text, you must perform complete entity and relationship extraction without skipping or omitting any part. Accuracy and comprehensiveness are the top priorities, even for texts as long as 100,000 words.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   6. Return only the structured output in the specified format-exclude all explanations, headers, or additional text.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   7. Return an empty output structure {\"entities\": [], \"relationships\": []} if the ontology is missing, invalid, or empty; if the source text is empty or irrelevant; or if no matching entities or relationships are found.\"\n",
      "   \n",
      "Output Format:\n",

      "      Each entity must be formatted as: \"<entity_type><|><entity_name><|><entity_content>\"\n",
      "      Where:\n",
      "         - <entity_type>: The class or type of the entity, strictly as defined in the ontology.\n",
      "         - <entity_name>: The canonical name of the entity, based on the ontology definition and valid extraction rules.\n",

      "         - <source_entity>: The <entity_name> of source entity.\n",
      "         - <target_entity>: The <entity_name> of the target entity.\n",
      "         - <relationship_type>: One of the relationship types defined in the ontology.\n",
