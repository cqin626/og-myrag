      "\t1. Extraction Logic\n",
      "      - For each potential relationship identified in the source text:\n",
      "         - If the relationship semantically matches a relationship type in the ontology based on llm-guidance, expected source and target entity types, and examples:\n",
      "            - Extract the relationship instance and its associated attributes as specified in Guideline 2.\n",
      "            - Extract the source and target entity instances associated with this relationship, following the instructions in Guideline 3.\n",
      "         - Otherwise:\n",
      "           - Skip the current relationship and proceed to the next.\n",
      "      - Output results using the format in Guideline 5.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   2. Relationship Attributes\n",
      "      - Each relationship in the ontology includes the following metadata, they are interpreted as follow to guide your extraction:\n",
      "\t\t\t1. `source`: The expected entity type of source entity instance defined in the ontology.\n",
      "\t\t\t2. `target`: The expected entity type of target entity instance defined in the ontology.\n",
      "\t\t\t3. `llm-guidance`: Defines the semantic meaning of the relationship and when it applies. Use this to validate whether a relationship in the source text qualifies for extraction. \n",
      "\t\t\t4. `examples`: Contextual references to guide interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - Each extracted relationship instance must have attributes as follow:\n",
      "         1. `id` (str, non-null): The unique identifier of the relationship which you need to generate on your own. Generate it in the format of `Rx`, for examples, `R1`, `R2`, `R3' and so on.\n",
      "\t\t\t2. `source_id` (str, non-null): The identifier of the expected source entity instance. It is also an identifier that you require to generate on your own as stated in Guideline 3.\n",

      "            (See example in Guideline 6)\n",
      "         6. `valid_in` (list of int, non-null): A list of years during which the relationship is valid. It is inferred from either the explicit temporal information stated in the source text or the implicit temporal information based on the publication date of the source text.\n",
      "      \n",
      "   3. Entity Attributes\n",
      "      - Each entity in the ontology includes the following metadata, they are interpreted as follow to guide your extraction::\n",

      "         2. `name` (str, non-null): A descritive name that:\n",
      "            - Aligns with the extraction guideline stated in the llm-guidance of entity type. \n",
      "            - Represents only one real-world instance. If the name includes multiple distinct entities (e.g., `Name1 / Name2`), split them into separate entities and establish individual relationships as needed.\n",
      "         3. `type` (str, non-null): The entity type, as defined in the ontology.\n",
      "         4. `desc` (str, non-null): A comprehensive descriptive statement that:\n",
      "            - Is written in reporting format. Do not include references to the source document itself, such as “this prospectus,” “this document,” or similar. Completely omit such phrases even if they appear in the source text.\n",
      "            - Describes the entity itself, while including **temporal context** inferred from either explicit temporal information stated in the source text or implicit information based on the source's publication date.\n",
      "            - Includes **limited relationship-dependent or contextual details** only when such information helps uniquely identify the entity (e.g., distinguishing it from other entities with the same name)).\n",
      "            - The description should be sufficient for a downstream agent or human to **disambiguate the entity from other similarly named entities**.\n",
      "            - All descriptive content must be **strictly based on the source text**. Do not include assumptions, inferences beyond the source, or unverified external knowledge.\n",
      "            (See example in Guideline 6)\n",
      "      - Only extract an entity instance if it is part of a valid relationship identified according to Guideline 1. Entities mentioned in the text but not involved in any extractable relationship should not be extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "   4. Handling of Duplicate or New Entity/Relationship Instances  \n",
      "      - Reuse an existing entity or relationship instance — and append complementary information if needed — **only if you are confident** that the current mention clearly refers to the **same real-world instance** already extracted, based on consistent identifying details and contextual alignment.  \n",
      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",
      "      - Your goal is to extract all contextually distinct instances. A separate agent will handle deduplication or merging of equivalent entities and relationships.\n",
      "\n",

      "            - Includes **limited relationship-dependent or contextual details** only when such information helps uniquely identify the entity (e.g., distinguishing it from other entities with the same name)).\n",
      "            - The description should be sufficient for a downstream agent or human to **disambiguate the entity from other similarly named entities**.\n",

      "      - Reuse an existing entity or relationship instance — and append complementary information if needed — **only if you are confident** that the current mention clearly refers to the **same real-world instance** already extracted, based on consistent identifying details and contextual alignment.  \n",
      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",
      "      - Your goal is to extract all contextually distinct instances. A separate agent will handle deduplication or merging of equivalent entities and relationships.\n",

      "            - Extract the relationship instance and its associated attributes as specified in Guideline 2.\n",

      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",

      "         1. `definition`: A formal description of the entity type descrbing its semantic meaning. Use this to determine the entity's relevance in context.\n",
      "         2. `llm-guidance`: Detailed instructions for extracting the **name** of the entity instances. Follow this strictly.\n",
      "         3. `examples`: Contextual references to guide interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "      - Each extracted entity instance must have attributes as follow:\n",
      "         1. `id` (str, non-null): The unique identifier of the entity which you need to generate on your own. Generate it in the format of `Ex`, for examples, `E1`, `E2`, `E3' and so on.\n",
      "         2. `name` (str, non-null): A descritive name that:\n",
      "            - Aligns with the extraction guideline stated in the llm-guidance of entity type. \n",
      "            - Represents only one real-world instance. If the name includes multiple distinct entities (e.g., `Name1 / Name2`), split them into separate entities and establish individual relationships as needed.\n",
      "         3. `type` (str, non-null): The entity type, as defined in the ontology.\n",
      "         4. `desc` (str, non-null): A comprehensive descriptive statement that:\n",
      "            - Is written in reporting format. Do not include references to the source document itself, such as “this prospectus,” “this document,” or similar. Completely omit such phrases even if they appear in the source text.\n",
      "            - Describes the entity itself, while including **temporal context** inferred from either explicit temporal information stated in the source text or implicit information based on the source's publication date.\n",
      "            - Includes **limited relationship-dependent or contextual details** only when such information helps uniquely identify the entity (e.g., distinguishing it from other entities with the same name)).\n",
      "            - The description should be sufficient for a downstream agent or human to **disambiguate the entity from other similarly named entities**.\n",
      "            - All descriptive content must be **strictly based on the source text**. Do not include assumptions, inferences beyond the source, or unverified external knowledge.\n",
      "            (See example in Guideline 6)\n",
      "      - Only extract an entity instance if it is part of a valid relationship identified according to Guideline 1. Entities mentioned in the text but not involved in any extractable relationship should not be extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "   4. Handling of Duplicate or New Entity/Relationship Instances  \n",
      "      - Reuse an existing entity or relationship instance — and append complementary information if needed — **only if you are confident** that the current mention clearly refers to the **same real-world instance** already extracted, based on consistent identifying details and contextual alignment.  \n",
      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",
      "      - Your goal is to extract all contextually distinct instances. A separate agent will handle deduplication or merging of equivalent entities and relationships.\n",

      "            - Includes **limited relationship-dependent or contextual details** only when such information helps uniquely identify the entity (e.g., distinguishing it from other entities with the same name)).\n",
      "            - The description should be sufficient for a downstream agent or human to **disambiguate the entity from other similarly named entities**.\n",
      "            - All descriptive content must be **strictly based on the source text**. Do not include assumptions, inferences beyond the source, or unverified external knowledge.\n",

      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",
      "      - Your goal is to extract all contextually distinct instances. A separate agent will handle deduplication or merging of equivalent entities and relationships.\n",

      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",

      "            (See example in Guideline 6)\n",
      "         6. `valid_in` (list of int, non-null): A list of years during which the relationship is valid. It is inferred from either the explicit temporal information stated in the source text or the implicit temporal information based on the publication date of the source text.\n",

      "         1. `id` (str, non-null): The unique identifier of the entity which you need to generate on your own. Generate it in the format of `Ex`, for examples, `E1`, `E2`, `E3' and so on.\n",
      "         2. `name` (str, non-null): A descritive name that:\n",

      "            - Includes **limited relationship-dependent or contextual details** only when such information helps uniquely identify the entity (e.g., distinguishing it from other entities with the same name)).\n",
      "            - The description should be sufficient for a downstream agent or human to **disambiguate the entity from other similarly named entities**.\n",
      "            - All descriptive content must be **strictly based on the source text**. Do not include assumptions, inferences beyond the source, or unverified external knowledge.\n",
      "            (See example in Guideline 6)\n",
      "      - Only extract an entity instance if it is part of a valid relationship identified according to Guideline 1. Entities mentioned in the text but not involved in any extractable relationship should not be extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "   4. Handling of Duplicate or New Entity/Relationship Instances  \n",
      "      - Reuse an existing entity or relationship instance — and append complementary information if needed — **only if you are confident** that the current mention clearly refers to the **same real-world instance** already extracted, based on consistent identifying details and contextual alignment.  \n",
      "      - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., differing context, insufficient information, or partial overlap), treat the mention as a **new instance** and generate a new `id`.  \n",
      "      - When uncertain, prioritize creating new instances to preserve contextual distinctions.  \n",
      "      - Your goal is to extract all contextually distinct instances. A separate agent will handle deduplication or merging of equivalent entities and relationships.\n",
