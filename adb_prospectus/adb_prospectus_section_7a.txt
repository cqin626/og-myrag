7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW
7.1 HISTORY
The table below sets out the key events and milestones of our history and development of our business since 1996:

Year Key events and milestones
1996
*   Ology Marketing Sdn Bhd was incorporated on 16 April 1996 by CYT, CCP and another shareholder, namely Ben Mah Chin Wooi @ Mah Chin Khong (who is not deemed a related party to CYT and CCP), to undertake the businesses of sale of computer hardware as well as development and sale of accounting software. Each shareholder held 1 share in Ology Marketing Sdn Bhd, representing equity interest of approximately 33.33% each.

1997
*   Ology Marketing Sdn Bhd changed its name to Business Component Enterprise Sdn Bhd on 29 May 1997.

1998
*   We officially launched our maiden accounting software, AutoCount Accounting, which was an on-premise accounting software with basic accounting modules such as general ledger, accounts receivable and accounts payable for book keeping purposes, that targets local small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) in Malaysia. AutoCount Accounting was developed on Paradox database (a file-based system) using Delphi programming language.
*   We enhanced our AutoCount Accounting by including additional modules that cover sales/invoicing and inventory management.

1999
*   We recorded our first overseas sale of AutoCount Accounting when we sold our software to Creative Software Pte Ltd in Singapore.

2000
*   BCE Software Sdn Bhd was incorporated on 28 November 2000 by CYT (with an equity interest of 50.00%) and CCP (with an equity interest of 50.00%) to focus on the development and sale of accounting software by assuming all accounting software business activities from Business Component Enterprise Sdn Bhd.
*   Simultaneously, we ceased our computer hardware business under Business Component Enterprise Sdn Bhd. Accordingly, CYT, CCP and Ben Mah Chin Wooi @ Mah Chin Khong ceased to become shareholders and directors of Business Component Enterprise Sdn Bhd upon the striking off of this company on 9 November 2010.

2002
*   We expanded our offerings by launching an on-premise payroll software, AutoCount Payroll. AutoCount Payroll was developed on Firebird database server (a database management system developed based on SQL technology) using Delphi programming language.

2003
*   We expanded our offerings by launching a portable accounting software, which is a combination of Pocket AutoCount (a front-end software running on personal digital assistants (“PDAs”)) and Auto Count XP (a back-end software that contains all the accounting information of a company).
    It is designed to allow employees, especially sales personnel to access customer and supplier information off-site, and key in sales orders, quotations and other information off-site. Information available in, and keyed in via Pocket Autocount, can be synchronised to Auto Count XP by plugging the PDAs to the devices which Auto Count XP are installed in. However, as PDA was considered costly and not widely used then, we did not focus on promoting this portable accounting software.

7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

Year Key events and milestones
2006
*   To improve the stability of our accounting software, we revamped and launched a new version of AutoCount Accounting which was developed using Microsoft .Net Framework and Microsoft SQL Server (a database management system as opposed to the file-based system which was used in the previous version of our AutoCount Accounting).
    With enhanced stability, it is able to cater for the increasing complexity of our software by giving us more flexibility to add new features and functions in the software. Further, the usage of Microsoft development toolkit was also in line with the increasing popularity of such development toolkit.

2007
*   Soft Merit Sdn Bhd was acquired by CYT and CCP from Sumami binti Kiman and Saharuddin bin Abdullah on 10 January 2007 as a shelf company, with the intention to assume all business operations of BCE Software Sdn Bhd.
*   Soft Merit Sdn Bhd changed its name to Auto Count Sdn Bhd on 31 January 2007 to undertake the development and sale of AutoCount software from BCE Software Sdn Bhd, in preparation to apply for MSC status for the company. The then remaining business of BCE Software Sdn Bhd was customisation of third party software. However, as we decided to focus on the development and sale of AutoCount software, we ceased the business of customisation of third party software under BCE Software Sdn Bhd in 2008 and Auto Count Sdn Bhd thus assumed the remaining operations (e.g. employees) of BCE Software Sdn Bhd. BCE Software Sdn Bhd was eventually struck off on 31 January 2015.
*   Auto Count Sdn Bhd was awarded MSC Malaysia status and was granted Pioneer Status which entitled it to a 100.00% exemption on taxable statutory income derived from approved MSC activities for 5 years until 25 September 2012, and was subsequently renewed for a further period of 5 years and was valid until 25 September 2017.
*   We further enhanced our AutoCount Accounting to enable our Authorised Dealers and third party software developers to carry out software customisation on our AutoCount Accounting by extending the functionalities of AutoCount Accounting according to end-user customers' requirements.
*   The enhanced AutoCount Accounting was also developed with readily available APIs to enable integration with third party software or IT systems. With these extensibility and integration features, we have transformed our AutoCount Accounting into a standard accounting software which can be used by our Authorised Dealers and third party software developers to provide vertical solutions to address different industry needs according to requirements by end-user customers.
*   We launched AutoCount Express, a simplified version of AutoCount Accounting specialised to serve SMEs with only one to two users with simplified features of general ledger, accounts receivables and accounts payable. As at LPD, AutoCount Accounting Express is no longer a standalone software offered by our Group, but it has been embedded as one of the editions available for sale (i.e. Express Plus) under our latest version of AutoCount Accounting.

Year Key events and milestones
2009
*   We further expanded our offerings by developing and launching AutoCount Retail POS, a POS software for retail businesses. AutoCount Retail POS was developed on Microsoft .Net Framework and Microsoft SQL Server. AutoCount Retail POS can also be integrated with AutoCount Accounting to enable daily sales postings for financial reporting purposes.

2010
*   We established an education team and formed partnerships with universities and colleges where we provide AutoCount accounting software to these universities and colleges to be included as part of their accounting course syllabus.
*   We began to publish AutoCount software tutorial videos and learning resources on YouTube through our existing employee's YouTube channel.

2014
*   Along with the announcement of the Goods and Services Tax ("GST") implementation, we launched an upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with Malaysia GST features.

2015
*   Our upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with GST features boosted our sales whereby Auto Count Sdn Bhd recorded 457.61% increase in total sales from FYE 31 December 2013 to FYE 31 December 2015 or a compound annual growth rate of 136.14%.
*   Prior to the release of the upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with GST features, Auto Count Sdn Bhd recorded a revenue of RM6.77 million in FYE 31 December 2013 (revenue generated from sales of accounting software: RM3.47 million). Subsequent to the release of the upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with GST features in 2014, Auto Count Sdn Bhd recorded a revenue of RM37.75 million in FYE 31 December 2015 (revenue generated from sales of accounting software: RM22.71 million). The significant increase in revenue was due to the enforcement of GST rule by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department that all businesses and companies with revenue above RM0.50 million must be registered with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department; and following which, the registered businesses and companies were encouraged to use computerised accounting software that are GST-compliant to ensure smooth transition in the implementation of GST. The Government also launched a RM1,000 GST e-voucher for SMEs to purchase or upgrade to GST-compliant accounting software. On 12 March 2014, AutoCount Accounting was accredited by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department as a GST-compliant accounting software that allows SMEs to claim for the RM1,000 GST e-voucher, which further boosted the sale of our upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with GST features.

2016
*   Along with the increasing proliferation of cloud computing and hosting, AutoCount On The Go Sdn Bhd was incorporated on 11 March 2016 by CYT (with an equity interest of 48.39%), CCP (with an equity interest of 48.39%) and Ho Siew Yin (with an equity interest of 3.22% and subsequently ceased to become a shareholder on 5 April 2018), to focus on the development of an extended cloud-native application to extend the functionalities of AutoCount Accounting, thereby providing a hybrid experience to users of our AutoCount Accounting.
*   We set up our own YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/AutoCountSoftware and began to publish AutoCount software tutorial videos and learning resources on it.

7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

Year Key events and milestones
2017
*   To enhance our business presence in Singapore and to better manage our business transactions with local customers in Singapore, AutoCount (S) Pte Ltd was incorporated on 17 May 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Auto Count Sdn Bhd. AutoCount (S) Pte Ltd serves as our sales office in Singapore to promote our AutoCount software to local customers and to serve customers more efficiently.
*   We launched AutoCount On-The-Go (“AOTG”), an extended cloud-native application to complement our AutoCount Accounting by providing a hybrid experience to users of our AutoCount Accounting. AOTG is catered for customers who subscribe to our AutoCount Accounting and want the flexibility to conveniently access basic data, accounting records and accounting functions through the internet.
*   The launch of AOTG marked our venture into the provision of SaaS and provided our Group with a recurring revenue stream as AOTG is offered on subscription basis.

2018
*   Along with the announcement of the Malaysia Sales and Services Tax ("SST") implementation, we launched an upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with SST features. Auto Count Sdn Bhd recorded a revenue of RM22.06 million in FYE 31 December 2018, of which RM6.01 million was from the sale of upgraded version of AutoCount Accounting with SST features for new end-user customers and software upgrade fees for existing end-user customers. There was no significant increase in Auto Count Sdn Bhd's revenue following the implementation of SST as the upgrade fees charged to our existing end-user customers were not material. Further, the market demand for accounting software with SST features were not as significant as accounting software with GST features as most enterprises and companies have bought their accounting software during the GST implementation and the SST doesn't apply to such a large number of businesses and companies as compared to GST.
*   We further expanded the range of our POS software by launching AutoCount F&B POS, a POS software for F&B businesses. AutoCount F&B POS was developed on Microsoft.Net Framework and Microsoft SQL Server. AutoCount F&B POS can also be integrated with AutoCount Accounting to enable daily sales postings for financial reporting purposes.

2019
*   We expanded our offerings under the SaaS model when we launched our first cloud-native software, AutoCount Cloud Payroll, a cloud version of our payroll software. AutoCount Cloud Payroll was built on Microsoft Asp.Net Core with Razor Page and hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since then, we focus on promoting our AutoCount Cloud Payroll which is offered on subscription basis.
*   We enhanced our AutoCount Retail POS by improving the stability of its data synchronisation functions and to allow payment through electronic wallet ("e-wallet").

*   We were identified as a Technology Solutions Provider by MDEC to support Malaysian SMEs in digital adoption under the SME Business Digitalisation Grant announced in Budget 2020.

2021
*   We launched AutoCount Cloud Accounting, a cloud-native AutoCount accounting software, which was built on Microsoft ASP.NET Core and React and hosted on Microsoft Azure.

2022
*   Through ACSB, we obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification issued by BSI Group of Companies for the provision of software development, desktop and cloud accounting, payroll and POS software, training and maintenance services. The certificate was accredited by Department of Standards Malaysia and ANSI National Accreditation Board. ISO/IEC 27001 is a standard for information security management system where it attests our ability in securing information stored in our software, our server and our premise.

2023
*   We launched AutoCount OneSales, a cloud-native POS software, which was built on Microsoft ASP.NET Core and React and hosted on Huawei Cloud.

7.2 PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
We are principally involved in the development and distribution of financial management software comprising accounting, POS and payroll under our "AutoCount" brand. Our range of AutoCount software is comprehensive as they are designed to support a wide range of fundamental finance and accounting functions of a business.

All our AutoCount software are developed in-house and distributed as off-the-shelf software to end-user customers through our network of Authorised Dealers and directly through our internal sales and marketing team. This allows us to focus our resources on continuous enhancement of our existing software and development of new software to cater to changing digitalisation needs of businesses and companies. We also provide technical support and maintenance services to our Authorised Dealers as part of our service offerings to them, and to our direct end-user customers upon request.

Since the revamp of our accounting software using Microsoft .Net Framework and Microsoft SQL Server in 2006 and up to LPD, we have sold approximately 70,000 AutoCount software licences for use by approximately 210,000 businesses and companies, primarily in Malaysia and Singapore.

Our Group's business model is as illustrated below:

The software is distributed through two main channels:
1.  A "Wide network of authorised dealers" (269 dealers in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and Myanmar, mostly software solution providers). These dealers:
    *   distribute AutoCount software for onward sales to end-user customers
    *   provide sale support, product, and technical training
    *   sell AutoCount software as part of their solutions (possibly customised) or standalone
    *   provide technical support and maintenance services
2.  Directly to "End-user customers" (Mainly comprise small and medium enterprises). The Group:
    *   sells AutoCount software directly to end-users
    *   provides technical support and maintenance services
    *   provides free courses, learning resources, and user guides via AutoCount Academy
The arrows show the flow from the in-house system supporting the software development, which is then distributed via dealers or directly to end-users.]

Our in-depth industry knowledge and programming expertise backed by our in-house programmers, in-house sales and marketing team and AutoCount Academy represent the core of our business. These elements form the supporting system to our network of Authorised Dealers and end-user customers to provide high quality software, sales support to our Authorised Dealers and easy access to related learning tools to drive continuous sales, subscription and usage of our AutoCount software. Please refer to Section 7.2.4 of this Prospectus for further details of our in-house supporting system.

7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

Our AutoCount software are distributed to our Authorised Dealers for sale to businesses and companies in the form of software licences. Please refer to Section 7.2.2 of this Prospectus for further details on the distribution modes of our software licences. Our network of Authorised Dealers comprises mostly software solution providers who are involved in the provision of software solutions using our AutoCount software as one or several of the modules of their software solutions. Please refer to Section 7.2.3 of this Prospectus for further details on our wide network of Authorised Dealers. There are also circumstances where we sell our AutoCount software directly to businesses and companies upon request by these end-user customers. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, our sales of financial management software to our Authorised Dealers accounted for 59.10%, 60.91%, 59.15% and 66.04% of our Group's total revenue respectively, and our direct sales of financial management software to businesses and companies accounted for 19.67%, 20.74%, 26.06% and 21.98% of our Group's total respectively.

Our target end-user customers are mainly SMEs. Over the years, our AutoCount software have been used by businesses and companies in multiple industries which include consumer products, F&B, trading, distribution, services, grocery retailing, construction, property development, hospitality, telecommunications and logistics to support their finance and accounting functions. These businesses and companies comprise mainly SMEs but we also have large organisations, including multinational companies and public listed companies as our end-user customers. We have large organisations such as Artroniq Berhad, LGMS Berhad and Unimech Group Berhad which use our software. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, based on management estimation, multinational companies and public listed companies constituted less than 1.00% of our total customer base.

We operate from our head office at Oasis Corporate Park in Petaling Jaya, Selangor and we have a sales office in Singapore.

AutoCount payroll software | autocount CloudPayroll | AutoCount Cloud Payroll | Cloud | Payroll Basic and Payroll Premium | 2019

Note:
(1) AutoCount OneSales was recently launched in February 2023 and is available to users free of charge as at LPD. The subscription plans of AutoCount OneSales are expected to be made available to our customers in the 2nd quarter of 2023.

Our AutoCount software can be used directly upon installation where users can access default and readily available functions in the respective software. Notwithstanding this, our AutoCount software is also designed to allow customisation to form vertical solutions to suit different needs of businesses and companies from different industries. The following are two examples of vertical customisations:
(i) to provide a vertical solution to an automotive repair shop, our AutoCount Accounting can be used by including features related to, amongst others, customer booking, record of car condition and usage of spare parts and consumables for each repair, as well as inventory management of spare parts and consumables.
(ii) to provide a vertical solution to a travel agency, our AutoCount Accounting can be used by including features related to, amongst others, customer booking, handling of traveller particulars, itinerary management and air ticket billing.

To complement our offerings, our Group has some additional modules and plug-ins mainly developed internally which are available for sale to customers who purchased our software. These modules (e.g. “Serial Number" and "Consolidated Financial Report") and plug-ins (e.g. "Workshop" for automotive repair shop and "Fixed Asset Register" for all kind of businesses) can be integrated to our software to form vertical solutions. Apart from the additional modules and plug-ins sold by our Group, our software can be customised and integrated with other modules and plug-ins developed by third parties. The customisation of our software is performed by our Authorised Dealers who are mostly software solution providers as part of their service offerings, when requested by end-user customers. For our on-premise software, our Authorised Dealers are able to enhance the software by including additional features and plug-ins that are specifically developed for businesses in certain industries (e.g. customer booking, record of car condition and usage of spare parts and consumables for each repair, as well as inventory management of spare parts and consumables for automotive repair shops), as well as integrate third party software (e.g. logistics management software and hotel management software) to our software. For our cloud-native software, our Authorised Dealers are able to integrate third party software (e.g. crane supply and management system) to our software. However, for both on-premise and cloud-native software, our Authorised Dealers are not able to re-design or modify our software by amending our source code, licence control and software identity (e.g. our logo and brand name). The customisation of our AutoCount software can also be performed by third party software developers engaged separately by our end-user customers. To protect the ownership of AutoCount software including the source code of our AutoCount software, we implement access control on our server whereby only certain key senior management and authorised programmers can access our server which stores the source code of our AutoCount software.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

Through ACSB, we obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certificate issued by BSI Group of Companies accredited by ANSI National Accreditation Board where it attests our ability in securing information stored in our software, our server and our premise. We also have confidentiality clauses entered with all our employees whereby our employees are not allowed to share any confidential information including the source code of our AutoCount software to any parties even if they resign from our Group. Further, we have installed data protection software on all our programmers' laptops to prevent unauthorised access or leakage of data including the source code of our AutoCount software in the event of, loss of laptops or stolen laptops.

As software customisation services are mainly provided by our Authorised Dealers, this allows us to focus our resources on continuous enhancement of our existing software and development of new software to cater to changing digitalisation needs of businesses and companies. Moving forward, our Group will continue to focus on enhancement of our existing software and development of new software, whilst continuing to refer or outsource software customisation works to our Authorised Dealers.

For clarification purpose, our AutoCount software is not patentable at this juncture as it is not considered a patentable invention which is eligible for patent protection (i.e. which requires a non-public invention involving an inventive step and which is industrially applicable), in view that functions developed in our AutoCount software are functions that are commonly found in many applications, and such functions can be developed by other software developers. Notwithstanding the absence of patent registration and the possibility of functions found in our AutoCount software being independently developed by other software developer, our AutoCount software has been developed by our Group and accordingly our Group as the creator, is the owner of intellectual property rights to our AutoCount software and such rights enjoy protection under legal principles relating to protection of trade secrets and is protected by the Copyright Act 1987. As such, we treat the AutoCount software as being proprietary to us. Furthermore, our Authorised Dealers are required to execute dealer agreement with us and pursuant to such agreement, our Authorised Dealers will undertake and comply with certain restrictive covenants, for example, not to do any act which would invalidate or put in dispute our Group's title to our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and acknowledges that our Group is the legal and beneficial owner of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in connection with our Group's products.

We envisage that our on-premise software namely AutoCount Accounting, AutoCount Retail POS and AutoCount POS will continue to be made available to the market as on-premise software for at least the next 5 years.

The details of each of our AutoCount software are detailed as follows:

(i) AutoCount accounting software
AutoCount accounting software was developed for businesses and companies to perform accounting functions digitally. Our AutoCount accounting software comprises several key modules, namely accounting module, sales module, purchase module and inventory module. Each of these modules comprise several sub-modules to serve different functions, as follows:

Modules | Sub-modules
------- | --------
Accounting module | General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and SST Submission
Sales module | Quotations, Sales Orders, Delivery Orders, Invoices, Credit Notes and Debit Notes, Sales Consignment
Purchase module | Purchase Request, Request Quotation, Purchase Orders, Goods Received Notes, Purchase Invoices, Purchase Returns and Purchase Consignment

As at LPD, we offer 2 types of accounting software, namely AutoCount Accounting and AutoCount Cloud Accounting as detailed below:

(a) AutoCount Accounting
autocount ACCOUNTING
AutoCount Accounting is our maiden accounting software developed and launched in 1998. Over the years, we continued to enhance the software and as at LPD, the latest version available for sale is AutoCount Accounting 2.0. AutoCount Accounting is an on-premise accounting software.

In addition to the basic functions under an accounting software, AutoCount Accounting provides automation of certain functions such as creation of recurring entries, generation of stock adjustments, calculation of SST and generation of sales analysis reports based on different metrices. Further, AutoCount Accounting is also equipped with functions related to budget planning, consolidation of financial reports, tracking of unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses and credit control. While the function of SST calculation does not require certification or approval from the respective regulators, our Group is responsible to ensure that the SST calculation function is accurate and in line with the latest regulatory requirements. If the SST calculation function in our software is inaccurate, it will affect our end-user customers' payment of SST to regulators, which will materially affect our reputation in the market and negatively impact our business. Hence, to ensure accuracy in SST calculation, our Group has performed studies and multiple rounds of testing prior to launching the software. Further, we also stay updated with any changes on the tax regimes implemented by the respective governments by attending seminars conducted by tax and accounting related firms or associations, and make necessary amendments to our software.

It is also user-friendly and developed with features such as integration with WhatsApp, an instant messaging application, for sending of documents; a customisable user interface and dashboard. Due to its ability to adapt to extensive functionalities and features, AutoCount Accounting is suitable for all businesses and companies including large organisations which require a comprehensive accounting software to handle complex day-to-day accounting functions and activities.

As at LPD, AutoCount Accounting is available in 5 editions, which are Account Plus, Express Plus, Basic, Pro and Premium, depending on the number of account books and user licences as well as modules required by end-user customers.

Please refer to some screenshots of AutoCount Accounting below for illustration purpose.

Different line styles indicate full transfer, partial transfer, and payment status. The bottom part shows a grid listing delivery order details like Doc. No., Date, Debtor, and Amount.]

In 2017, we launched AOTG, which is an extended cloud-native application to complement our AutoCount Accounting by providing a hybrid experience to users of our AutoCount Accounting. AOTG is catered for businesses and companies who subscribe to our AutoCount Accounting and want the flexibility to conveniently access basic data, accounting records and accounting functions through internet connectivity. AOTG allows users off-premise access to certain data and accounting records stored in the server of AutoCount Accounting using web browsers. This increases the accessibility of the software at anytime from anywhere via internet connection. It also facilitates businesses with sales personnel who are often out of the office by enabling access to selected information to complete their paperwork off-site such as preparing quotations, key in sales records and generate digital invoices. For clarification purpose, AOTG is different from AutoCount Cloud Accounting detailed in Section 7.2.1(i)(b) as end-user customers of AOTG must have purchased, installed and used on-premise AutoCount Accounting before they can access to, and/or use, AOTG. As at LPD, AOTG is available in 3 subscription plans, which are Essential, Basic and Premium, depending on the size and business of the end-user customers, modules required and number of users.

(ii) AutoCount POS software
AutoCount POS software was developed for businesses and companies to manage sales records and transactions digitally. As at LPD, we offer 2 types of POS software, namely AutoCount POS and AutoCount OneSales as detailed below:

(a) AutoCount POS
autocount POS
AutoCount POS is an on-premise POS software developed and launched in 2009. AutoCount POS allows businesses and companies to digitally store and manage sales records, and can be integrated to our AutoCount Accounting to enable daily sales postings for financial reporting purposes.

Our AutoCount POS allows centralised management of POS functions for multiple outlets, such as management of product pricing and promotions in all outlets and real time synchronisation of sales from multiple outlets through internet. Our AutoCount POS supports multiple payment modes including cash, cards, vouchers, reward points and e-wallets. Further, AutoCount POS is also complemented by our in-house developed mobile application, eDashboard, where sales summary from multiple outlets can be accessible by authorised personnel (e.g. management of business owners) through mobile devices in various reporting parameters such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly sales, and sales by outlets or branches. In addition, our AutoCount POS consists of front-end modules to cover functions related to amongst others, order placing, receipt issuance and day-end closing. 1 AutoCount POS license can be used by 1 POS counter or 1 outlet/ branch only. For businesses with multiple branches, the license price for POS counter in main branch is different from the license price for POS counters in their outlets/ branches, depending on the total number of licenses purchased.

Our AutoCount POS is also designed with user access rights control feature whereby any entries entered and confirmed in our AutoCount POS cannot be changed, removed or voided by users without authorisation. Entries can only be voided and re-entered upon approval by higher-level users with the required authorisation, thereby increasing the integrity of transaction records. As AutoCount POS is an on-premise POS software, it is not dependent on internet to operate. An example of possible downtime for AutoCount POS is when customers experience POS hardware malfunction.

It provides end-user customers flexible access to the software to manage and consolidate sales generated from physical stores and online marketplaces, at anytime from anywhere through internet connection.

(iii) AutoCount payroll software
autocount P CloudPayroll
AutoCount Cloud Payroll is a cloud-native payroll and HR software launched in 2019. It enables HR duties to be executed digitally with functions including payroll, time attendance tracking, claim processing, leave management and employee profile management. AutoCount Cloud Payroll is accessible on the web and on our in-house developed mobile application, namely AC Payroll, which allows users to access our AutoCount Cloud Payroll functions using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

As a cloud-native software, software updates are automated for users to enjoy the latest features available and thus eliminating the need for end-user customers to manually download and install updates. Further, data and payroll records stored in the software are automatically backed up on cloud servers securely every 15 minutes.

Our AutoCount Cloud Payroll has a dashboard feature that presents a summary of HR records comprising leave entitlement, balance and application status, claims status and headcount details. The access rights to HR records in our AutoCount Cloud Payroll can be controlled and determined based on users' role and designation.

Our AutoCount Cloud Payroll is developed with features and functions for end-users to fulfil all the latest statutory regulations of Malaysian statutory bodies related to employee's payroll such as Employee Provident Fund (“EPF”), Social Security Organisation ("SOCSO”) and Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (“LHDN”) and human resource development fund contribution matters with Human Resource Development Corporation ("HRD Corp"). It is equipped with the latest forms from these statutory bodies for users to download conveniently.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

It also has templates which can be used to generate HR letters and payslips. Save for the computerised calculation of monthly tax deductions that requires approval from the LHDN, the calculation of other statutory transactions such as transactions relating to EPF, SOCSO and HRD Corp do not require approvals from the respective statutory bodies. Nevertheless, our Group is responsible to ensure that the calculation of these statutory transactions is accurate and in line with the latest regulatory requirements. If these calculation functions in our software are inaccurate, it will affect our end-user customers' payment of these statutory transactions to regulators, which will materially affect our reputation in the market and negatively impact our business. Hence, to ensure accuracy in the calculation of these statutory transactions, our Group has performed studies and multiple rounds of testing prior to launching the software. Further, we also stay updated with any changes on the contribution schemes related to employee's payroll implemented by the Government of Malaysia and make necessary amendments to our software.

Further, employees are able to apply for leaves and submit claims, check leave and claim balances as well as download payslips through the Employee Self Service Portal in our AutoCount Cloud Payroll and AC Payroll.

Our AutoCount Cloud Payroll can be integrated with our AutoCount Accounting for the preparation of financial reports.

As at LPD, AutoCount Cloud Payroll is available in 2 subscription plans, which are Payroll Basic and Payroll Premium, depending on the number of employees, HR personnel and modules required by the end-user customers.

Our end-user customers who have previously purchased our on-premise AutoCount payroll software can continue to have access to the software but all our on-premise AutoCount payroll software will be deemed end-of-life product by December 2023. Further, our end-user customers who have previously purchased our on-premise AutoCount payroll software can also switch to AutoCount Cloud Payroll by subscribing to AutoCount Cloud Payroll and pay for the monthly or yearly subscription fees accordingly. Since the launching of AutoCount Cloud Payroll in 2019 and up to LPD, there were 124 end-user customers who switched from our on-premise AutoCount payroll software to AutoCount Cloud Payroll.

7.2.2 Distribution of software licences
There are 2 distribution modes of software licences for our software, i.e. perpetual licence for all on-premise software, and subscription licence for all cloud-native software. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, the total number of perpetual and subscription licences sold were 5,352, 5,480, 7,850 and 10,201 respectively. The details of the distribution mode of our software licences are as follows:

[Diagram Interpretation: The diagram titled "Distribution of software licences" shows two main licence types branching out: "Perpetual licence" for "On-premise software" and "Subscription licence (SaaS model)" for "Cloud-native software".
Under each licence type, it breaks down the "Revenue stream from new customers" and "Revenue stream from existing customers" along with their respective "Driving factors".
For Perpetual licence (On-premise):
*   New Customers: Driven by new business establishment, digitalisation embarkation, migration from other software. Revenue from: One-off sale of licences, engagement of technical support/maintenance.
*   Existing Customers: Driven by business continuation/expansion/growth. Revenue from: Upgrade of software edition, Sale of additional user licences (Accounting), Sale of additional POS counter/outlet (POS), Sale of additional modules/plug-ins, Renewal of technical support/maintenance (marked as recurring income(1)).
For Subscription licence (Cloud-native):
*   New Customers: Revenue from: Initial subscription of software licences.
*   Existing Customers: Driven by business continuation/expansion/growth. Revenue from: Recurring fixed-term subscription (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly - marked as recurring income(1)), Upgrade of subscription plan, Sale of additional modules, Sale of additional user access (Cloud Accounting/Payroll), Sale of additional employee headcount (Cloud Payroll).
Footnote (1) indicates recurring income.]

(i) Perpetual licence
Software licences for all our on-premise AutoCount software (i.e. AutoCount Accounting and AutoCount POS) are sold on a one-off basis whereby end-user customers (including end-user customers who purchase our software through our Authorised Dealers) will purchase the software licences upfront and will be granted with perpetual access to the software. These end-user customers include newly established businesses and companies, as well as businesses and companies which embark on business digitalisation or migrate from other financial management software. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, the total number of perpetual licences sold were 5,057, 4,279, 5,467 and 6,166 respectively.

As these end-user customers continue and/or expand their business, they may upgrade their software edition to access to more comprehensive functions, and/or request for additional user licences (for AutoCount Accounting) and/or POS counter/outlet (for AutoCount POS). They may also purchase additional modules and plug-ins from our Group for integration to our software to enhance the functions. In addition, end-user customers who purchase software directly from our Group may engage us for our technical support and maintenance services on an annual and renewable basis, with details set out in Section 7.2.5 of this Prospectus.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

When a new version of our on-premise AutoCount software with major upgrades (such as a change of taxation basis from GST to SST, and revamp of the entire software user interfaces) is released, the older version will no longer be sold in the market. Nevertheless, users who previously purchased the older version shall continue to have access to the software even if the version is deemed end of life. Users who wish to upgrade their on-premise AutoCount software to the latest version will need to incur an upgrade fee to access the new version. There is no fixed frequency or time interval between the release of new version of our on-premise software as the release of new version of our on-premise software is subject to changing market requirements (e.g. a change of taxation basis implemented by governments) and trends as well as the digitalisation needs of businesses and companies. Our AutoCount Accounting was last upgraded to AutoCount Accounting 2.0 and our AutoCount POS was last upgraded to AutoCount POS 5.0, both in August 2018.

All of the above enable our Group to continue to generate revenue from our customers despite the sale of perpetual licences on a one-off basis.

The software licence for our on-premise AutoCount software can be delivered in the form of unique software licence identifier or dongle, depending on our customer preference. With the unique software licence identifier option, our Authorised Dealers can assist the businesses and companies to install the software into their computers which are connected to their organisation's IT network for on-premise usage. With a dongle, the dongle must always be plugged into the user's device to access our on-premise AutoCount software.

(ii) Subscription licence (SaaS model)
Software licences for all our cloud-native AutoCount software are sold on a fixed term subscription basis. AutoCount Cloud Accounting is sold on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription basis; AutoCount Cloud Payroll is sold on a monthly and yearly subscription basis; and our extended cloud-native application (i.e. AOTG) is sold on a half-yearly and yearly subscription basis. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, the number of new subscription licences sold were 91, 1,183, 2,140 and 2,326 respectively. For information, the total subscription licences (including renewed subscriptions) sold in the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022 were 295, 1,201, 2,383, and 4,035 respectively.

The subscription model of our cloud-native AutoCount software provides our Group with recurring revenue as the end-user customers continue to use our software. In FYE 2019, FYE 2020 and FYE 2021, the renewal rate of subscription licences was 72.53%, 75.40% and 70.05% respectively. The renewal rate of subscription licences for FYE 2022 is not applicable as some of the subscription licences sold in FYE 2022 are yet to be due for renewal as at LPD.

Further, as these end-user customers expand their business, they may upgrade their subscription plan to access to more comprehensive functions, and/or purchase additional modules and plug-ins from our Group for integration to our software to enhance the functions. Further, they may request for additional user access (for AutoCount Cloud Accounting and AutoCount Cloud Payroll) and/or additional employee headcount (for AutoCount Cloud Payroll).

These subscription licences are on a SaaS model whereby the software is managed and hosted by our Group and users subscribe for the usage of the software and access it through the internet. End-user customers can enjoy the latest updates throughout the subscription period and software updates are done automatically.

Our AutoCount software are mainly sold to businesses and companies through our network of Authorised Dealers who are mostly software solution providers that are involved in the provision of software solutions using our AutoCount software as one or several of the modules of their software solutions. These Authorised Dealers (i.e. software solution providers) typically customise our AutoCount software to form vertical solutions in order to suit the needs and requirements of end-user customers. Our Authorised Dealers are not required to inform or report to our Group on the customisation done on our AutoCount software for their customers. Further, our Authorised Dealers may also sell our AutoCount software as a standalone product to businesses and companies.

In certain circumstances, our Group also sell our AutoCount software directly to end-user customers (i.e. businesses and companies). This allows us to focus our resources on continuous enhancement of our existing software and development of new software to cater to changing digitalisation needs of businesses and companies and hence, we prefer to engage our Authorised Dealers to provide customisation and training services to end-user customers. However, if the end-user customers approach our Group directly and do not require much customisation to our software, our Group will attend to such customers.

In addition, certain Authorised Dealers of our Group will refer their customers to our Group if such customers wish to apply for a government grant announced by MDEC under Budget 2020 for, among others, purchase of accounting, payroll and POS software (“SME Business Digitalisation Grant"). In order to apply for the SME Business Digitalisation Grant, only authorised Technology Solutions Provider is eligible to submit the application for their customers, to Bank Simpanan Nasional (“BSN"), a partner of MDEC. As our subsidiary, ACSB is an authorised Technology Solutions Provider, the Authorised Dealers of ACSB who are not authorised Technology Solutions Provider, will refer such customers to purchase AutoCount software from ACSB directly and subsequently ACSB will facilitate the application for the SME Business Digitalisation Grant. Upon receiving the approval from BSN, if the customers require additional services to set up the accounting software and to provide training to the customers' personnel, our Group will engage the same Authorised Dealers who referred the customers to ACSB to provide such services.

In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, the revenue derived from our customers who applied for the SME Business Digitalisation Grant and the relevant costs incurred by our Group to appoint the Authorised Dealers to provide additional services to set up the accounting software and to provide training to the customers' personnel, are as follows:-

As at LPD, our Group has a total of 269 Authorised Dealers across most states and federal territories in Malaysia (256 Authorised Dealers), Singapore (7 Authorised Dealers), Indonesia (3 Authorised Dealers), Brunei (2 Authorised Dealers) and Myanmar (1 Authorised Dealer). The type of software distributed by each of our Authorised Dealers is based on selection by the respective dealers and approved by our Sales and Marketing Director. Subsequently, the dealer agreement with respective dealers will be signed by our Managing Director. As at LPD, most of our Authorised Dealers are allowed to distribute more than 1 type of AutoCount software, whereby 213 Authorised Dealers are allowed to distribute AutoCount Accounting, 253 Authorised Dealers are allowed to distribute Autocount Cloud Accounting, 187 Authorised Dealers are allowed to distribute AutoCount POS, and 130 Authorised Dealers are allowed to distribute AutoCount Cloud Payroll.

Our Group enters into dealer agreements with our Authorised Dealers to distribute our AutoCount software to end-users. The dealer agreements signed with our Authorised Dealers are generally for 1 year, and are renewable upon expiry. To become our Authorised Dealers, the dealers are generally required to commit to an annual sales target and make a one-off advance purchase of a certain amount of AutoCount software licences as mutually agreed between our Group and the respective dealers and recorded as our revenue. The annual sales target is committed by our Authorised Dealers through an advanced payment upon entering the dealer agreement with us, which will be recognised as pre-payment for purchases of software licences from our Group.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

The purchase of software licences by the Authorised Dealers from our Group will first be offset from the advanced payment, and subsequent purchases of software licences by the dealers after hitting the sales target will be paid to our Group based on per order basis. Authorised Dealers are not allowed to purchase software licences merely to meet annual sales target. Further, it is unlikely for Authorised Dealers to do so as any licenses issued (to end customers) must be registered in AutoCount software's license portal and the annual sales target set are generally achievable by our Authorised Dealers. In the past 3 FYEs 2019 to 2021, failure to achieve the annual sales target may result in our Authorised Dealers subjecting to an annual dealer support and maintenance fee amounting to RM1,200 payable to our Group. Commencing FYE 2022, our Authorised Dealers who fail to achieve the annual sales target may be subject to a non-refundable advance payment amounting to RM5,000, which will be utilised for purchase of software licences and the unutilised amount will be forfeited after 12 months. Further, new Authorised Dealers who are unable to meet sales target may be recommended to collaborate with other more experienced Authorised Dealers for support.

To expand our sales and assist our Authorised Dealers in achieving the sales targets, our Group provides sales support (i.e. marketing materials) and monitors the performance of our Authorised Dealers. We also provide product and technical training to our Authorised Dealers on software customisation, troubleshooting and software update/revision (e.g. software improvements and bug fixes), to ensure the Authorised Dealers have sufficient technical knowledge to market and sell our AutoCount software. Further, we may participate in sales meetings with our Authorised Dealers and their customers, when required, to provide support pertaining to technical information and product knowledge.

Our AutoCount software can also be sold to businesses and companies through sub-dealers who are registered under our Authorised Dealers. These sub-dealers are required to fill in a registration form with our Group for record purposes. However, the respective Authorised Dealers are responsible for providing training and support to their sub-dealers based on the terms agreed between the respective Authorised Dealers and sub-dealers for the distribution of our AutoCount software to end-user customers. Further, in the event of default by the Authorised Dealers or sub-dealers including any complaints and claims such as financial and legal claims, the Authorised Dealers will be responsible for defaults attributed to them and to their respective sub-dealers. Based on our dealer agreement, we are also indemnified against the aforementioned financial and legal claims should such claims arise against our Group.

7.2.4 Our in-house supporting system
We adopt a business model which emphasises on developing good quality software for distribution to end-user customers by our Authorised Dealers. We leverage on our wide network of Authorised Dealers to sell and distribute our software, and our Authorised Dealers are backed by our in-house supporting system which is built on 3 core areas, i.e. in-depth industry knowledge and programming expertise, in-house sales and marketing support and AutoCount Academy, as follows:

(i) In-depth industry knowledge and programming expertise
Our Promoters, CCP and CYT have been in the business for approximately 27 years, whereby we have accumulated vast experience and knowledge in developing financial management software to support the fundamental finance and accounting functions of a business. This is backed by our understanding of the needs of businesses and companies, as well as our in-depth industry experience and knowledge in optimising the entire finance and accounting workflow of a business, to achieve a seamless flow of information between multiple business functions as well as accurate and real time data reporting.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

Further, our expertise in software programming also enables us to develop user-friendly software and software that can be easily and conveniently customised to form vertical solutions for end-user customers from different industries.

(ii) In-house sales and marketing support
While we leverage on our network of Authorised Dealers to distribute and sell our AutoCount software to end-user customers, we maintain an in-house sales and marketing team as we recognise that it is crucial to have a dedicated team to support our Authorised Dealers in carrying out sales and distribution of our software. This in-house sales and marketing team is responsible for planning and executing sales and marketing activities detailed in Section 7.6(i) of this Prospectus, recruiting new dealers, maintaining relationships with our Authorised Dealers, providing sales support and technical training to our Authorised Dealers, preparing quotations and attending to enquiries. With this support and assistance, our Authorised Dealers are prepared and confident to market our products to potential end-user customers.

(iii) AutoCount Academy
Our AutoCount Academy is managed by our education team. AutoCount Academy, which was launched in 2020, is a one-stop online self-learning platform where we consolidate all our free courses, learning resources and user guides on our AutoCount software from various sources and provide access to the general public at academy.autocountsoft.com. It has a wide range of tutorials, videos and user manuals of our AutoCount software, thus serving as a library for our Authorised Dealers to understand our software thoroughly. Further, AutoCount Academy also provides an access link to user guides as well as a coding references on wiki.autocountsoft.com for users who want to customise their user experience in AutoCount software. Through these materials, our Authorised Dealers are able to understand the mechanism quickly and provide relevant services to end-user customers.

With the aim to enhance our brand exposure and image, we also partner with universities and colleges to include AutoCount accounting software as part of their accounting software course syllabus. Upon completion of the accounting software course, students will be awarded a certification issued by our Group. This enhances our brand recognition which is advantageous for our business expansion. In the Financial Years Under Review, our Group partnered with 47 universities and colleges for inclusion of AutoCount accounting software as part of their accounting software course syllabus.

With our in-house supporting system in place to support our Authorised Dealers in selling and distributing our software, our Group can focus our resources on continuous enhancement of our existing software and development of new software to cater to changing digitalisation needs of businesses and companies, thereby sustaining our business in the long term.

7.2.5 Technical support and maintenance services
Our Group's direct end-user customers (i.e. customers to whom we sell financial management software directly without going through our Authorised Dealers) can engage us for our technical support and maintenance services on an annual and renewable basis. Our technical support and maintenance services are provided to assist customers in updating and maintaining our AutoCount on-premise software, whereby complementary software revisions, comprising minor enhancements such as software improvements and bug fixes, for our on-premise software are made available for these customers, and we will install the software revisions remotely from our office or be present at their premises to assist in installing the software revisions. Further, we will also assist our customers in resolving or troubleshooting technical issues during the service durations.

As for our cloud-native software, we have a complementary live chat function which allows users to seek technical assistance from us as part of our after-sales services, as detailed in Section 7.2.6 of this Prospectus.

As at LPD, we have existing service engagements with approximately 2,000 customers with a service duration of up to 3 years, out of which 86.31% of these customers are repeated customers. These service engagements are subject to renewal by our customers depending on the customers' requirements.

7.2.6 After-sales service
As part of our after-sales services, we provide a 90-day warranty for our on-premise software. During the warranty period, if any defects are found in our software (e.g. the software does not perform as per our published specifications for the applicable version), we will either provide a replacement of the defective software or a refund of the licence fees paid for the affected software to our customers. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, our Group did not receive any warranty claims from customers for the sale of our on-premise software. For our cloud-native software, we do not provide any warranty as the software is sold on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis.

Apart from the warranty provided, for on-premise software, complementary software revisions, comprising minor enhancements such as software improvements and bug fixes, are made available for our Authorised Dealers to install the revisions for their end-user customers, and for our end-user customers who purchase software directly from us and continue to engage our technical support and maintenance services. While there is no warranty provided for our cloud-native software, software updates of cloud-native software are automated for all users to use the latest features available. These software revisions and updates are released from time-to-time to rectify minor software bugs whenever they arise or for minor enhancements of report formats and user interface. Please refer to Section 7.2.5 for further details on our provision of technical support and maintenance services.

Our Group does not provide technical support and maintenance services to our Authorised Dealers' end-user customers. Technical support and maintenance services are provided by our Authorised Dealers to their end-user customers based on their respective arrangements. Nevertheless, in the event a revision is made to our on-premise software, our Group will provide the software revisions to our Authorised Dealers to install the revisions for their end-user customers.

As for our cloud-native software, we have a live chat embedded in the software which is managed by our customer support team, where users can seek technical assistance from us during working hours. This function is available for all our cloud-native software users regardless of whether they are our direct end-user customers or end-user customers secured through our Authorised Dealers.

    *   Cloud-native path: Subscription of plans -> Delivery.
3.  **After-sales:** Follows Delivery. It includes three parallel activities: "Software revisions or updates", "Technical support and maintenance (for direct end-user customers)", and "Product trainings".]

Software development
Under the software development stage, we identify and gather information relating to the latest market requirements and trends as well as the digitalisation needs of businesses and companies in terms of financial management, and thereafter design and develop a new software or enhance our existing software accordingly. Following which, the new or enhanced software will be tested internally and thereafter the software will be launched to the market. Further, we will provide training to our Authorised Dealers on the features and technical specifications of the new and enhanced software. Please refer to Section 7.10 of this Prospectus for further details on the key stages of our software development activities.

Sales and delivery
Our software are sold to businesses and companies through our network of Authorised Dealers and through our in-house sales and marketing team. The process of sales and delivery for our on-premise software and cloud-native software is detailed as follows:

(i) On-premise software
The software licences for our on-premise software are sold and delivered in the form of unique software licence identifier or dongle. When our Authorised Dealers receive a sales order from end-user customers (i.e. businesses and companies) for our on-premise software, these Authorised Dealers will place orders with us and we will generate unique software licence identifiers or prepare dongles based on the software editions specified by the end-user customers, to be provided to the dealers. With the unique software licence identifier option, the Authorised Dealers will assist the end-user customers to install the software into their computers which are connected to their organisation's IT network for on-premise usage.

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
7. BUSINESS OVERVIEW (cont'd)

With a dongle, the Authorised Dealers will hand over the dongles to the end-user customers and the dongles must always be plugged into the user's device to access our on-premise AutoCount software. Depending on the end-user customer requests, our dealers may perform software customisation to the end-user customers as part of their service offerings.

Similarly, when our sales and marketing team receives a sales order directly from end-user customers who do not require much software customisation, we will generate and issue a unique software licence identifier or dongle based on the software editions specified by the end-user customers, followed by software implementation and training. Software implementation for our on-premise software can be performed remotely or physically at our end-user customers' offices. For customers who require major software customisation, our Group will refer to our Authorised Dealers to provide such services.

(ii) Cloud-native software
Our cloud-native software is sold on a subscription basis which is under a SaaS model whereby the software is managed and hosted by our Group while the users subscribe for the usage of the software and access it through the internet.

Our cloud-native AutoCount software are mainly subscribed to and paid for through our website directly, except for the yearly subscription of AutoCount Cloud Payroll where the end-user customers will make the payment to us based on invoices issued by our Group. For subscription through our website, once the payment is made, the end-user customers can start using the software by accessing it through web browsers from any device and anywhere. If the end-user customers are referred by our Authorised Dealers, they can enter the dealer code (i.e. a unique code generated by us and assigned to each of our Authorised Dealers) when subscribing. Following which, we will apportion certain commission percentage to the Authorised Dealers based on the achieved sales.

After-sales
Our Group provides a 90-day warranty for our on-premise software to our customers, while there is no warranty provided for our cloud-native software. Please refer to Section 7.2.6 of this Prospectus for further details of our warranty. Apart from the warranty provided, for on-premise software, complementary software revisions are made available for our Authorised Dealers to install the revisions for their end-user customers, and for our end-user customers who purchase software directly from us and continue to engage our technical support and maintenance services. Meanwhile, software updates of cloud-native software are automated for all users to use the latest features available.

Further, we provide technical support and maintenance services to our direct end-user customers upon engagements based on an annual and renewable basis, while technical support and maintenance services are provided to our Authorised Dealers' end-user customers through our Authorised Dealers based on their respective arrangements. Please refer to Section 7.2.5 and Section 7.2.6 of this Prospectus for further details of our software revisions and updates as well as technical support and maintenance services.

We also provide product trainings to our Authorised Dealers and end-user customers in the form of tutorials, videos and user manuals through our online self-learning platform, AutoCount Academy. It serves as a library for our Authorised Dealers and end-user customers to understand our software thoroughly. Please refer to Section 7.2.4(iii) of this Prospectus for further details of our AutoCount Academy.
