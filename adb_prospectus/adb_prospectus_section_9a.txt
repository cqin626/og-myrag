1. CCS & CO PLT was registered on 29 December 2022 and with effect from such date, CCS & CO, a conventional partnership, was converted to a limited liability partnership.

The involvement of our Executive Directors in other directorships or business are not expected to affect their contributions to our Group as they are principally involved in our Group's day-to-day operations. Our Executive Directors are passive investors in other businesses. Their involvement in other directorships or businesses do not require significant amount of time since our Executive Directors are not actively involved in the day-to-day operations in any business activities outside our Group, and hence does not affect their abilities to perform their executive roles and responsibilities to our Group as well as their contribution to our Group.
The involvement of our Independent Non-Executive Directors in other directorships or business outside our Group will not affect their contribution to our Group as they do not act in any executive capacity and are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our Group.
