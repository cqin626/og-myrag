3.4 Impact of COVID-19

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, there were several rounds of office closure due to lockdown measures imposed by the Government of Malaysia, as our business is not deemed as essential services and we were not allowed to open our office. There were minimal interruptions to our business operations as we were unable to conduct physical meetings and trainings with our employees and Authorised Dealers, or perform software implementation physically at our end-user customers' office. Nevertheless, we conducted virtual meeting and training sessions, and performed software implementation remotely. As such, there was minimal impact to our business operations in Malaysia pursuant to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For our Singapore operations, since the imposition of circuit breaker in April 2020, our office had been closed until the re-opening of our office in March 2021 with limitation on workforce capacity as our Group was deemed as non-essential services. Save for the restrictions on conducting physical meetings and trainings with our employees and Authorised Dealers as well as inability to perform software implementation physically, there was no other impact to our business operations in Singapore pursuant to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite several rounds of office closure during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no material impact to our business operations and our Group managed to record revenue growth for the FYE 2020 and FYE 2021.

Please refer to Section 7.14 of this Prospectus for further information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our Group.

(iii) We offer a range of financial management software which can be integrated and customised to suit different needs of businesses and companies
Our Group offers 3 types of financial management software, comprising accounting software, POS software and payroll software under our “AutoCount" brand. These software can be used by businesses and companies on a standalone basis, or co-integrated with each other (e.g. integration between AutoCount Accounting and AutoCount POS Retail) to form a comprehensive system to support day-to-day business operations. Such integration ensures seamless connectivity between the different software under different business functions and streamlines the flow of data and information (e.g. sales data, commission and payroll record) across these business functions, which simplify financial and sales reporting process for better and timely decision making.

(iv) Our experience, knowledge and expertise in the development of financial management software enable us to continuously upgrade and adapt our software to changing market requirements and trends
Having been in the financial management software industry for approximately 27 years, we have accumulated relevant experience and knowledge in developing software to support businesses' and companies' accounting and other business functions.

Amongst our Authorised Dealers, most of them are software solution providers which are involved in the provision of software solutions using our AutoCount software as one or several of the modules of the software solutions together with some customisations to provide vertical solutions to their customers.

3.6 Business Strategies and Plans

Our future plans and strategies are as follows:

(i) We intend to expand our business presence to Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Philippines; as well as continue to expand our business in Singapore
As at LPD, our Group operates from our offices in Malaysia and Singapore, which are the main countries we derived our sales from. In the past 4 FYEs 2019 to 2022, revenue generated from Malaysia accounted for 83.15%, 78.58%, 75.10% and 80.65% to our Group's total revenue respectively, whereas Singapore accounted for 15.18%, 20.06%, 24.19% and 18.72% to our Group's total revenue respectively.

We also plan to further expand our business in Singapore for the sale of cloud-native software. As at LPD, our Group only offers on-premise software in Singapore.

(a) Establishment of offices;
(b) Hiring of personnel for each country;
(c) Undertake sales and marketing activities; and

Further details on our business strategies and plans are set out in Section 7.8 of this Prospectus.

3.7 Risk Factors

Our business is subject to a number of risk factors which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the key risk factors that we face in our business operations:

(i) We are dependent on our Executive Directors and Key Senior Management team for continued success and growth of our business
Since inception, the success of our Group has been attributed to the experience, industry knowledge and network, and skills of our Executive Directors and Key Senior Management team. The growth and future success of our Group will continue to be dependent on the continuous contribution from our Executive Chairman, CCP and our Managing Director, CYT for their leadership in setting the strategic direction and driving the business development of our Group.

(ii) We are dependent on our team of programmers
Our ability to retain and to attract competent and skilled programmers is crucial for our continued success, future business growth and expansion. Any loss of our programmers and our inability to find suitable replacements in a timely and cost-efficient manner may cause disruptions to our business operations and our ability to respond to technical issues and changes in technology quickly.

(iii) We depend on third party cloud computing and hosting platform to function our AutoCount cloud-native software
All our AutoCount cloud-native software are hosted on third party cloud computing and hosting platforms. As such, our Group is dependent on the quality, reliability, service upgrades, capacity and network connectivity of the third party cloud computing and hosting platforms for the hosting of our cloud-native software. If there are any major unforeseen interruptions in our third party cloud computing and hosting platforms, which are beyond our control, our end-user customers' user experience may be adversely affected, whereby our users may have limited or no access to our cloud-native software, and subsequently may have an adverse impact on our Group's reputation.

(iv) We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies
The implementation of our business strategies may be influenced by factors beyond our control, such as changes in general market conditions, economic climate as well as political environment in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, which may affect the commercial viability of our business strategies.

12

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY (cont'd)

(v) We may be exposed to the risk of security breaches
Our customers' information and all data generated from our cloud-native software are stored on third party cloud platform and transmitted through the internet. Storage of data electronically and data transmission over the internet may expose our database to external security threats such as malware attacks, hacking, espionage or cyber intrusions, as well as internal security breaches which include unauthorised access to restricted information by our employees. In the event where there are security breaches on the third party cloud platform which we subscribe to that lead to leakage of our customers' information to unauthorised parties, our reputation and relationship with our customers may be adversely affected. Further, it may also lead to loss of customers' confidence in our Group which will adversely affect our industry reputation.

(vi) Our ownership rights may be infringed and / or we may inadvertently infringe on third party's ownership rights
As all our AutoCount software are developed in-house by our Group, we retain the ownership rights of our software. However, there can be no assurance that the ownership rights will adequately protect our software against any infringement by third parties. Further, in the development of our software, including all on-going and future enhancements and modifications, there are possibilities that we could inadvertently infringe ownership rights held by third party(s). This would result in the risk of the third party challenging our Group's ownership rights or taking legal action against us.

(vii) We are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risks which may impact the profitability of our Group
We are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk which was mainly arising from our revenue exposure to SGD, which constituted 15.18%, 20.07%, 24.19% and 18.72% of our total revenue in the FYEs 2019 to 2022 respectively. We currently do not have a formal policy with respect to our foreign exchange transactions, and we do not hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As such, we are subject to foreign exchange fluctuation risk for our revenue and purchases denominated in foreign currencies which we transact, especially the SGD. Moving forward, we intend to expand to other Southeast Asia countries including Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. As such, our exposure to foreign exchange risk is expected to increase.

(viii) Our business and operations may be exposed to sudden disruptions caused by serious pandemic and epidemic outbreaks
On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 virus, also known as the novel coronavirus was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organisation. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Malaysia has imposed various degrees of nationwide movement restrictions. On 1 April 2022, the Government of Malaysia began the transition into an Endemic Phase with relaxed COVID-19 measures.
During the movement restriction periods, there were several rounds of mandatory closure of our office, and our Authorised Dealers' offices were also closed at the same time. Despite our employees working from home during the periods of office closure, there were minimal interruptions to our business operations as we were unable to conduct physical meetings and trainings with our employees and Authorised Dealers as well as perform software implementation physically at our end-user customers' office.

13

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY (cont'd)

(ix) Our investments in R&D may not yield returns and may not positively contribute to our business operations
Despite the commitments and efforts placed into R&D, there is no assurance that our R&D activities will yield results and develop software which suit the digitalisation needs of all businesses and companies that can substantially improve our financial performance. Further, if the development of new software or enhanced software are not able to complete in a timely manner, it could result in the loss of opportunities available in the market.

(x) Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that may arise in the course of our business operations
We maintain insurance at levels that are customary in our industry to protect against various losses and liabilities. However, in the event of claims, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that might be incurred in our operations as a result of any unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, we will be subject to the risk that, in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount desired at reasonable rates. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.

Further details on the risks faced by our business and operations, industry and investment in our Shares are set out in Section 5 of this Prospectus.
