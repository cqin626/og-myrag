Our Listing is an exempt transaction under Section 212(8) of the CMSA and is therefore not subject to the approval of the SC.

The SC had, vide its letter dated 17 January 2023, noted the resultant equity structure of our Company pursuant to our Listing under the equity requirement for public listed companies ("Equity Requirement"). ACSB was awarded the MSC Malaysia status by Government (represented by the Minister of Finance Malaysia and Minister of International Trade and Industry Malaysia) on 26 September 2007 ("MSC Malaysia Status"), and was the major contributor to the Group's after-tax profit for the Financial Years Under Review. Accordingly, ADB is exempted from the Equity Requirement.

Nevertheless, if we undertake subsequent proposals involving:

(ii) any acquisition which results in a significant change in our business direction or policy,

we must submit such application to the SC under the Equity Requirement for a reassessment.
