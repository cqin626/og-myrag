Notes:

(1) Regional expansion to capture growth opportunities

As at LPD, apart from our operations in Malaysia, we have an office in Singapore and Authorised Dealers in amongst others, Indonesia. As part of our plan to expand regionally in the ASEAN region, we intend to expand our team in Singapore and set up offices in the capital cities of the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. We believe that having a physical presence in these countries will better facilitate the localisation and awareness of our AutoCount software for us to penetrate the respective markets. This will enable us to establish a regional sales and marketing team for each country to support the growth of our business across the ASEAN region.

We intend to allocate approximately RM17.35 million, representing 56.19% of the gross proceeds from our Public Issue, for the regional expansion across the ASEAN region within 36 months from the date of Listing. Further details are set out in the table below:

Details	RM'000

(2) Strengthening our R&D to expand our existing products' features

Our Group recognises the increasing demand for technology application and infrastructure solutions in all industries and we wish to strengthen our R&D and technology capabilities in order to maintain our competitiveness as well as increase our market presence.

Such increase in our hosting and storage capacities is required for our Group to accept more customers and to ensure our existing and new software are operating without disruption.
