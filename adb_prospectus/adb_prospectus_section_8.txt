1 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IN MALAYSIA
A financial management software is a computer program designed to manage businesses' financial activities such as keeping track of income, expenses, assets and liabilities, as well as managing financial transactions with internal parties (e.g. employees) and external parties (e.g. customers and suppliers). Financial management is one of the most important aspects of managing a business as it involves amongst others, planning, organising, monitoring and controlling the businesses' financial resources, performance and growth. Efficient financial management can be achieved through the use of financial management software, as follows:

automation of certain basic tasks and fundamental processes related to financial management, including data entry and financial reporting which can otherwise be time-consuming, repetitive and prone to error if done manually.

increase data accessibility where data entered can be synchronised across multiple modules within the software for accessibility by authorised users.

convenient and quick generation of reports (e.g. sales summary and payroll summary) with different metrices, which gives business owner(s) and / or management quick insights for decision making.
There are different types of financial management software, each designed to meet the different financial management needs of a business. Examples of financial management software are:

► Accounting software
Accounting software is commonly used by businesses ranging from small and medium enterprises ("SMEs") to large organisations to facilitate accounting and bookkeeping tasks. A typical accounting software contains numerous accounting functions including general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, sales orders, purchase orders, delivery orders and inventory management. These functions are linked to one another to streamline and automate accounting and bookkeeping tasks including payment, billing, invoicing, account reconciliation and financial reporting.
► POS software
POS is the point at which sales of goods / services to customers are made. POS software is part of a POS system which also includes POS hardware such as monitor / tablet, barcode scanner, contactless payment terminal, receipt printer and cash drawer, to process customer payments.
POS software is commonly adopted by businesses such as retailers and food and beverage outlets. POS software can be integrated with accounting software as monetary transactions performed through POS software are required to be reflected in accounting records for financial reporting.
► Payroll software
Payroll software digitalises the payroll process and certain human resource related functions. A basic payroll software assists in managing various tasks including the documentation of employee personal information and remuneration package, salary disbursements, reimbursements, leave management as well as time attendance tracking, which are related to accounting and finance especially in calculating salary costs and related expenses. As such, payroll software can also be integrated with accounting software as salaries and related expenses are required to be reflected in accounting records for financial reporting.
Traditionally, accounting, POS and payroll software were widely available as on-premise software. Over the years, with the advancement of technology, the cloud version of these software have become increasingly common.

On-premise software: software that is installed and operated on the user's local server located within the user's premises. Users are required to be present on-site in order to access the software.

Cloud software: software that is installed and operated on external servers, leveraging on cloud computing and storage technology which enables users to access the software anytime from anywhere through internet connection.

Value chain of the financial management software industry
A general value chain of the financial management software industry is as follows:

[Diagram showing the value chain:
Starts with "Software principals" (icon of building with computer chip pattern) on the left.
An arrow points to "Dealers" (icon of several connected figures) in the middle.
An arrow points from "Dealers" to "Businesses (end-user customers)" (icon of city buildings) on the right.
Between "Software principals" and "Dealers", a central box labelled "Financial management software" is shown. Surrounding this box are related services: "Consultation", "Software customisation", "Software implementation", "Integration and configuration", "Technical support and maintenance", "User training". Arrows indicate these services connect the software to the dealers/end-users.
Text explanation to the right of the diagram: Software principals are the owners of financial management software. Software principals may develop financial management software in-house or outsource the development works to third party software developers. Financial management software is typically sold to end-user customers (i.e. businesses) through dealership distribution models, where software principals leverage on dealers to widen their distribution network and thus, enabling them to increase their market reach.]

2 KEY INDUSTRY DRIVERS, RISKS AND CHALLENGES OF THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IN MALAYSIA
Key Industry Drivers
► Growing number of businesses signifies growth potential for the financial management software industry
The number of businesses (i.e. companies, sole proprietorships and partnerships) in Malaysia increased from 8.88 million in 2019 to 10.32 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.14%, which indicates the growth potential of the financial management software industry in Malaysia.
Regardless of the size of the business or complexity of the financial management processes involved, most businesses require a form of financial management software to manage their financial resources efficiently.
Further, as businesses grow, the functions, features and modules required in a financial management software increase in tandem with the business needs. As such, businesses may upgrade their financial management software to more advanced versions over time, which can be easily achieved as most financial management software available in the market are scalable according to business needs. This is expected to sustain the demand for financial management software in the long term.

► Businesses' need for the automation of financial management processes drives the demand for financial management software
The automation of financial management processes with the use of financial management software allows businesses to, amongst others, save time and increase financial management efficiency. As a result, it enables businesses to focus their time and resources on managing their business operations.
Accounting, POS and payroll software are amongst the common financial management software adopted by businesses, due to the following factors:

Accounting software
Accounting is a necessary function for businesses to record their financial transactions which will be used for financial reporting and decision making.
Financial transactions such as sales, purchases, payments and borrowings have to be recorded in journal entries and posted to ledgers. In addition, financial transactions involve the preparation and

142

8. INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd)

SMITH ZANDER

issuance of purchase orders and invoices to suppliers and customers respectively. Financial transactions processes can be repetitive and time-consuming; and even prone to error if done manually and in large volumes. With an accounting software, these processes can be automated which enhances the efficiency of businesses' financial management processes. In addition, accounting software is typically able to perform data analysis to provide businesses with insights of their financial conditions for better and more effective management of their financial resources.


POS software
POS software can automate POS functions such as sales recording and inventory management. Sales recorded in POS software can be automatically posted to accounting software through integration between these two software. In addition, POS software automates inventory management function by notifying retailers when certain stocks are running low for retailers to replenish the stocks on a timely basis. As such, having a POS software is crucial for businesses, especially retailers in facilitating sales and improving operational efficiency.
Further, due to the competitive nature of the retail industry, there is a growing need for retailers to differentiate themselves by providing personalised services and enhanced shopping experience through loyalty rewards. This can be automated through POS software that comes with customer loyalty management function to manage amongst others, member purchases and discounts as well as points collection and redemption.
From 2020 to 2021, the retail industry in Malaysia, measured by the value of retail sales, increased from RM511.01 billion to RM533.56 billion at a YOY of 4.41% amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the retail industry in Malaysia further increased YOY by 23.89% to RM661.05 billion. Along with the increasing popularity and adoption of online shopping, many businesses have ventured into e-commerce by establishing online stores to increase sales and widen customer reach. These businesses may integrate a POS software to their online stores to streamline their business operations, which subsequently is expected to drive the demand for POS software by retailers.

Payroll software
Payroll is an integral part of a business as it involves employee remuneration and the management of employee personal information. A typical payroll software is able to manage payroll tasks and certain human resource related functions, as well as automate fundamental payroll processes. The payroll records in the payroll software can be automatically posted to accounting software for the calculation of staff costs in financial reporting through integration between these software.
Furthermore, the information recorded in payroll software can be used to generate reports that show the overall cost incurred by businesses for employee remuneration. Payroll software with data analysis function can also make use of existing information recorded to, amongst others, provide forecasts for employee remuneration to enable businesses to plan for payroll budget. By adopting payroll software, businesses are able to carry out payroll processes with greater accuracy and speed, which will subsequently enhance the efficiency of their financial management processes.
Despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial management software industry continues to grow as more businesses adopt financial management software to undertake or accelerate digitalisation efforts for business sustainability. Moving forward, in order to remain competitive in a technology-driven economy, there is a growing need for businesses to adopt the use of technology including financial management software to become more fast-paced through automation which increases the efficiency in financial management.
► Continuous technology advancement and changes in business environment drive the demand for financial management software
The financial management software industry has undergone technology advancement, in tandem with new and more robust technologies introduced in the market such as cloud computing and storage as well as big data analytics. Many software principals have integrated these new technologies into financial management software to improve business mobility (i.e. the ability to access the software from anywhere) and enhance user experience, as follows:

Cloud computing and storage technology enables the development of cloud software whereby users can access the software anytime from anywhere via internet connection; and

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

As technology continues to evolve and businesses strive to remain competitive, there will be continuous demand from businesses for new or updated financial management software which are more robust and equipped with enhanced functions to assist in realising their business growth plans.
► Implementation of digital transformation initiatives by the Government of Malaysia drives the financial management software industry
The Government of Malaysia has introduced initiatives to support business digitalisation efforts which drive the financial management software industry. In the Budget 2020, the Government of Malaysia introduced the SME Digitalisation Grant Scheme to encourage SMEs to adopt digitalisation efforts in their business operations. Through this initiative, the Government of Malaysia will provide a matching grant of 50% whereby the Government of Malaysia will subsidise 50% of the total invoice and up to RM5,000 per company for the subscription of digital services including accounting and taxation, electronic POS system and human resource payroll system. The allocated grants are worth RM500 million which are limited to the first 100,000 SMEs that apply over the course of 5 years.
The latest blueprint introduced to accelerate the growth of the digital economy is known as the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDigital), which was launched on 19 February 2021. The blueprint serves as a foundation for Malaysia's transformation into a "regional digital pulse" by 2030 with some targets listed below:

Accelerating digitally-powered businesses by having 875,000 micro enterprises and SMEs to adopt e-commerce, attracting local and foreign companies into the country, investing RM70 billion in digitalisation, and increasing the number of start-ups to 5,000; and

Accelerating a digitally-enabled government by having 100% of government servants possess digital literacy, 80% of end-to-end government services available online, all ministries and agencies to provide cashless payment options and 80% usage of cloud storage across the Government of Malaysia in 2022.
In the Budget 2021, in support of automation and modernisation, the Government of Malaysia allocated funds amounting to RM150 million to businesses, including micro enterprises, SMEs and start-ups that have been operating for at least 6 months under the SME Digitalisation Grant Scheme and the Automation Grant. Further in the Budget 2022, the Government of Malaysia allocated RM200 million with RM50 million dedicated towards Bumiputera micro entrepreneurs in rural areas in the SME Digitisation Grant Scheme.
In the revised Budget 2023 announced on 24 February 2023, the Government of Malaysia announced several digital transformation initiatives including the allocation of funds for SMEs to support business automation and digitalisation. Amongst the funds provided is the allocation of RM100 million under the SME Digitalisation Grant Scheme to fund matching grants of up to RM5,000 to SMEs that subscribe to business digitalisation software including accounting software, POS software or inventory management software. In addition, RM1 billion will be allocated under Bank Negara Malaysia for the SME Automation and Digitalisation Facility ("ADF") to encourage SMEs to automate processes and digitalise operations. Through the ADF, SMEs can receive financing amount of up to RM3 million with a tenure of up to 10 years at a loan rate of up to 4% per year (including guarantee fee).
These budget allocations will continue to drive businesses to digitalise business processes, including the adoption of financial management software, thereby driving the financial management software industry.

Key Industry Risks and Challenges
► Inability of industry players to adapt to the latest technological development
Industry players face the risk of not being able to adapt to the latest technological development. Their ability to adapt and enhance their financial management software to remain technologically relevant determines the sustainability of their businesses and their ability to retain and grow their customer base.
For example, industry players that develop and host their cloud financial management software on third party cloud computing platforms must be able to continuously update their software to remain compatible to any changes in technological features adopted by these third party cloud computing platforms. In the event that the industry players fail to keep up with technological developments timely, they may experience

5
144

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
8. INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd)

SMITH ZANDER

a loss of customers, which may in turn adversely impact their business sustainability and financial performance.
► Dependency on the availability of experienced software developers in the market
Industry players require software developers that possess certain experience and fundamental skillsets such as the abilities to code in certain programming languages; debug the software if errors are discovered during software testing; and perform coding review. Further, knowledge in financial management is also essential to develop practical and user-friendly features and functions in financial management software.
In the IT industry, these technical skillsets may be difficult to source as experienced personnel with a combination of IT skillset as well as financial management knowledge may not be widely available in the market at competitive salary rates. In the event that industry players are unable to source for suitable talent that meet their requirements timely and in sufficient numbers, they may experience slowdown in software development and face challenges in upkeeping and enhancing their software. Subsequently, this may affect the industry players' competitive edge and eventually impact their business sustainability.
► Businesses' privacy and security concerns towards financial management software
A major concern from businesses regarding the use of financial management software is the exposure to cyber security threats such as malware attacks or hacking which pose security risks to their confidential information. The accessibility aspect of financial management software, particularly cloud financial management software via the internet, renders financial management software vulnerable to such threats from hackers, who may mount attacks on the businesses' network to steal confidential information.
In the event that there are security breaches of the financial management software which lead to the leakage of the businesses' confidential information, businesses may lose confidence in the security of financial management software in general. As such, the demand for financial management software may be adversely impacted.

3 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Competitive Overview
The financial management software industry in Malaysia is competitive and moderately fragmented. There is a wide selection of financial management software available in the market as these software range in terms of price points and functionalities, and are accessible to end-user customers through various sources including direct from software principals, through appointed local dealers or on online channels. Software principals who offer financial management software in Malaysia comprise local private companies, as well as foreign private and public-listed companies without local presence in Malaysia and may offer their software locally through appointed local dealers. However, some of these local and foreign software principals may focus on offering other types of software while offering accounting software as part of their product offering and thus, are not included in the analysis of competitors of Autocount Group.
Financial management software that emphasises on basic functions is simpler and more affordable, which is primarily targeted at, and used by, SMEs. This type of financial management software focuses on dedicated functions such as accounting, POS and payroll. Examples of these software include the financial management software offered by Autocount Group.
On the other hand, enterprise resource planning ("ERP") solutions are more complex software that integrates financial management functions with other business functions including, amongst others, manufacturing, supply chain, project management, compliance management and risk management, into a single software. Examples of these software include the ERP solutions offered by Oracle, SAP and Workday. ERP is primarily targeted at, and used by, large organisations to handle complex functions and workflows for large numbers of users. Hence, ERP providers are not included in the analysis of competitors of Autocount Group as they have different target customers.
Industry players compete in terms of price and software functions. The barriers to entry are moderate as industry players require expertise in financial management as well as IT to develop their financial management software and enhance software functions. Industry players are also dependent on the availability of experienced software developers that are equipped with a combination of IT skillset as well as financial management knowledge. In addition, industry players require a wide network of dealers to market and

145

Registration No. 202201006885 (1452582-U)
8. INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH REPORT (cont'd)

SMITH ZANDER

distribute their software to end-user customers. To remain competitive in the industry and to have a sustainable business over the long term, it is essential for industry players to build and maintain business relationships with their network of dealers to expand their market reach. However, as there are no industry-specific licences or permits required to become a software principal other than ordinary business licences, existing industry players may also face competition from new market entrants.

Competitors to Autocount Group
Autocount Group is a software principal based in Malaysia which is principally involved in the development and distribution of financial management software, comprising accounting software, POS software and payroll software that primarily target SMEs. Autocount Group competes with other software principals which offer financial management software that also target SMEs in Malaysia, comprising software principals with local presence in Malaysia, as well as software principals without local presence in Malaysia and may offer their software locally through appointed local dealers.
For Autocount Group's competitors that are software principals with local presence in Malaysia, the basis for selection are as follows:
(i) Companies which offer accounting software that mainly target SMEs, as Autocount Group's revenue is mainly derived from the sales of accounting software licences and its target market is SMEs. These companies may or may not offer other types of financial management software; and
(ii) Companies that recorded more than RM3.00 million in revenue based on their respective latest available financial years.
The competitors to Autocount Group identified based on the basis for selection above are as follows:
