6.2 Our Group

(i) An overview of our Group structure before the Acquisitions is as follows:

Interpretation of Diagram: Group Structure Before Acquisitions

The diagram illustrates the ownership structure of the entities that would eventually form the ADB Group before the Acquisitions took place.

Top Level Shareholders:

CCP held 41.02% in ACSB.

CYT held 41.02% in ACSB.

A group of individuals collectively held 17.96% in ACSB. These individuals are listed as:

Ng Boon Thye (5.83%)

Lim Kim Seng (5.83%)

Liaw Huah Seng (2.91%)

Tey Wah Sheng (1.94%)

Lee Chern Siong (1.45%)

CCP held 50.00% in ASSB.

CYT held 50.00% in ASSB.

CCP held 41.00% in AOTGSB.

CYT held 41.00% in AOTGSB.

Lai Guan Siong held 9.00% in AOTGSB (part of an 18.00% block).

Tan Yeow Sing held 9.00% in AOTGSB (part of an 18.00% block).

Intermediate Holding/Operating Companies:

ACSB: Owned by CCP (41.02%), CYT (41.02%), and the group of individuals (17.96%).

ASSB: Owned 50% by CCP and 50% by CYT.

AOTGSB: Owned by CCP (41.00%), CYT (41.00%), Lai Guan Siong (9.00%), and Tan Yeow Sing (9.00%).

Subsidiaries:

ACSPL: 100.00% owned by ACSB.

AMCL: 100.00% owned by ACSPL (with a note indicating 2 shares were held in trust by CYT for ACSPL).

ADB: This entity (Autocount Dotcom Berhad) is shown connected below ASSB, indicating it was likely part of the structure but perhaps not fully integrated or active in the same way pre-acquisition, or its role changed. The diagram shows ASSB linked to ADB, but no ownership percentage is given between them at this stage in this particular diagram layout, though ASSB and ADB are linked below CCP and CYT.

Flow:

Arrows indicate ownership flow downwards from shareholders to intermediate companies (ACSB, ASSB, AOTGSB) and further down to their subsidiaries (ACSPL, AMCL).

ADB is shown linked below ASSB.

ACSB, ASSB, and AOTGSB appear as separate entities under common shareholders (CCP, CYT, etc.) before the consolidation under ADB.

Note:
(1) 2 of 50,000 shares of AMCL were previously held in trust by CYT for ACSPL. The beneficial owner of the 2 shares is ACSPL as it was then a requirement to have at least 2 shareholders in a company incorporated in Myanmar. ACSPL had on 12 May 2022 completed the disposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMCL to U Thet Tun Oo (a Myanmar citizen) for a total consideration of USD50,000.

(ii) An overview of our Group structure as at LPD is as follows:

Interpretation of Diagram: Group Structure as at LPD

This diagram shows the ownership structure of the ADB Group as at the Latest Practicable Date (LPD), 15 March 2023, after the Acquisitions of ASSB and AOTGSB, but just before the Acquisition of ACSB was completed (though the share consideration was determined based on this structure). The diagram reflects ADB as the main holding company.

Top Level Shareholders of ADB:

CCP held 41.02%.

CYT held 41.02%.

A group of individuals collectively held 17.96%. These individuals are listed as:

Ng Boon Thye (5.83%)

Lim Kim Seng (5.83%)

Liaw Huah Seng (2.91%)

Tey Wah Sheng (1.94%)

Lee Chern Siong (1.45%)
(Note: These percentages reflect the pre-IPO holdings in ADB resulting from the share swap in the Acquisition of ACSB, which technically completed post-LPD but the structure reflects the intended consolidation)

Holding Company:

ADB (Autocount Dotcom Berhad): This is the parent company of the Group.

Direct Subsidiaries of ADB:

ACSB: 100.00% owned by ADB.

ASSB: 100.00% owned by ADB.

Subsidiaries of ACSB:

ACSPL: 100.00% owned by ACSB.

AOTGSB: 100.00% owned by ACSB.

Flow:

Ownership flows downwards from the shareholders (CCP, CYT, and the individual group) to the holding company, ADB.

ADB directly owns 100% of ACSB and ASSB.

ACSB, in turn, owns 100% of ACSPL and AOTGSB.

This structure represents a consolidated group under ADB, incorporating the previously separate entities (ACSB, ASSB, AOTGSB, and ACSPL) through the Acquisitions. AMCL is no longer part of the structure as it was disposed of.

(iii) An overview of our Group structure upon Listing is as follows:

Interpretation of Diagram: Group Structure upon Listing

This diagram illustrates the expected ownership structure of the ADB Group immediately after the completion of the IPO and Listing on the ACE Market.

Top Level Shareholders of ADB:

CCP: Holds 30.76%.

CYT: Holds 30.76%.

Group of Individuals: Collectively hold 13.48%. These individuals are listed with their individual post-IPO percentages:

Ng Boon Thye (4.37%)

Lim Kim Seng (4.37%)

Liaw Huah Seng (2.19%)

Tey Wah Sheng (1.46%)

Lee Chern Siong (1.09%)

Public Shareholders: Collectively hold 25.00% following the IPO.

Holding Company:

ADB (Autocount Dotcom Berhad): Remains the publicly listed parent company.

Direct Subsidiaries of ADB:

ACSB: 100.00% owned by ADB.

ASSB: 100.00% owned by ADB.

Subsidiaries of ACSB:

ACSPL: 100.00% owned by ACSB.

AOTGSB: 100.00% owned by ACSB.

Flow:

Ownership flows downwards from the shareholders (CCP, CYT, individual group, and Public Shareholders) to the holding company, ADB.

ADB directly owns 100% of ACSB and ASSB.

ACSB owns 100% of ACSPL and AOTGSB.

The key difference from the LPD structure is the introduction of Public Shareholders holding 25.00% of ADB and the corresponding dilution of the original shareholders' stakes. The underlying operational structure of the subsidiaries remains the same.

6.2.1 Acquisitions

In conjunction with, and as an integral part of our Listing, ADB had undertaken the following Acquisitions:

(i) Acquisition of ACSB

The acquisition by ADB of 100.00% equity interest in ACSB comprising 515,000 ordinary shares from original shareholders of ACSB, i.e. CCP, CYT, Liaw Huah Seng, Lim Kim Seng, Lee Chern Siong, Tey Wah Sheng and Ng Boon Thye for a purchase consideration of RM8,007,509.00 was fully satisfied by the issuance of 456,914,998 new ADB Shares at an issue price of approximately RM0.018 per ADB Share pursuant to the share sale agreement dated 9 May 2022 (as supplemented on 21 June 2022). Based on the aforementioned supplemental agreement, the purchase consideration of RM8,007,509.00 is based on the pro forma combined NA of ACSB as at 31 December 2021 of RM8,007,509.00 which had been arrived at as follow:

	(RM)
ACSB	6,920,157
ACSPL	1,263,215
AOTGSB	(156,655)

(ii) Acquisition of AOTGSB

The acquisition by ACSB of 100.00% equity interest in AOTGSB comprising 300,000 ordinary shares from original shareholders of AOTGSB, i.e. CCP, CYT, Tan Yeow Sing and Lai Guan Siong for a purchase consideration of RM300,000.00 was fully satisfied in cash pursuant to the share sale agreements all dated 18 February 2022. The purchase consideration of RM300,000.00 is based on the basis of original investment cost, which represents the share capital in AOTGSB, as paid by the aforementioned original shareholders. The Acquisition of AOTGSB was completed on 15 April 2022.

(iii) Acquisition of ASSB

The acquisition by ADB of 100.00% equity interest in ASSB comprising 5,500 ordinary shares from original shareholders of ASSB, i.e. CCP and CYT for a purchase consideration of RM5,500.00 was fully satisfied in cash pursuant to the share sale agreements all dated 6 April 2022. The purchase consideration of RM5,500.00 is based on the basis of original investment cost, which represents the share capital in ASSB, as paid by the aforementioned original shareholders. The Acquisition of ASSB was completed on 9 May 2022.

For information, we had determined our purchase consideration for our acquisition of AOTGSB and ASSB based on our original investment costs in these companies as these companies were in a net liabilities position. We acquired ACSB based on its pro forma combined NA as the transaction was merely to facilitate the shareholders of ACSB to become shareholders of ADB, being the holding company of ACSB, and for our Group to have the same pro forma combined NA assuming all our subsidiaries have been combined as a group.
