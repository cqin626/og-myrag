Our Directors are of the view that all the above related party transactions were transacted on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms which are not more favourable to the related parties than those generally available to third parties and were not detrimental to our non-interested shareholders based on market price for comparable products/raw materials.

After our Listing and in accordance with the Listing Requirements, we may be required to seek our shareholders' approval each time we enter into material related party transactions. However, if the related party transactions can be deemed as recurrent related party transactions, we may seek a general mandate from our shareholders to enter into these transactions without having to seek separate shareholders' approval each time we wish to enter into such related party transactions during the validity period of the mandate.

In the event there are any proposed related party transactions that require prior approval of our shareholders, our Directors, major shareholders and/or persons connected with them who have any direct or indirect interest in the proposed related party transactions shall abstain from deliberation and voting on resolution(s) pertaining to the respective transactions. Under the Listing Requirements, related party transactions may be aggregated to determine its materiality if the transactions occurred within a 12-month period, are entered into with the same party or with parties related to one another or if the transactions involved the acquisition or disposal of securities or interests in one corporation/asset or of various parcels of land contiguous to each other.

After our Listing, the Audit and Risk Management Committee will review the terms of any related party transactions and ensure that any related party transactions (including any recurrent related party transactions) are carried out on terms not more favourable to the related party than those generally available to the third parties dealing at arm's length basis with our Group and are not to the detriment to our minority shareholders. Our Group will seek such relevant shareholders' approval where required.
