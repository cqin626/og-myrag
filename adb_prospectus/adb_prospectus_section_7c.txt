INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our Group is not highly dependent on any of the trademarks in view that our business and profitability are more dependent on other contributing factors
such as our experienced Executive Directors and Key Senior Management team, our in-house supporting system, our wide Authorised Dealer network
and others as outlined in Section 7.7 of this Prospectus. We do not foresee any material impact to our Group's business or profitability in the event of
non-approval for registration/ renewal of the trademarks. For clarification purpose, our Group has applied for registration of trademarks in certain
countries where our Group does not have customers as at LPD as part of its long term expansion plan.
Save for the registered trademarks/ applications for registration as disclosed below, our Group does not have any trademarks, registrations, applications
for registration and other intellectual property rights as at LPD:
